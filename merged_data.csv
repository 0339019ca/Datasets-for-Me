R2FK6YBRHFTCMK,B0C8PSMPTH,"5.0 out of 5 stars Arguably as good or better than AirPods Pro Max for WAY less money, and USB-C",Tim Page,5,"These are not the overpriced, boomy, distorted Beats of the early 2000s. Ever since Apple acquired them, Beats has been making products that rival or surpass Apple's own at lower prices, and its like people haven't noticed. I have a pair of the AirPods Pro Max that my wife likes to borrow, as well as the older Beats Studio with the hated Micro USB port, which I actually find more comfortable to wear, especially if casually walking around or lying on the couch, but doesn't sound *quite* as good-- still respectable, but in a wired desk situation I still prefer my Sony MDR7506s on *well* mastered music (they're built for monitoring, so if a recording sounds bad, they're supposed to make you notice, ideally so you can fix it). So, when I saw this on a Prime Day sale I jumped at it. This pair of Beats uses USB-C to charge like every modern device *should* do, is just as lightweight and comfortable as the old ones, sounds noticeably better (I believe they upgraded the drivers and also learned some fancy new DSP tricks over the last few years), especially in the detail and control-- seriously, sound is subjective, but to me they sound at least 95% as good as the AirPods Pro Max and up there with a pair of Sennheiser HD650s I used to own that unfortunately got stolen (also, those were wired and open-backed, so not really a fair comparison, especially in the convenience and portability department). They also have all of the cool whiz-bang features of the more expensive AirPods (anc, transparency, surround, find my, easy pairing and switching). Unless and until Apple comes out with a new improved AirPod Pro Max equivalent that addresses the ergonomic shortcomings of the original (namely lightning charger, weight, balance, and clamping) I think these are the new king.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2024",AEAQHGLXYFP57C3J5S6ZIK42NNOQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R2UXJLAZR33T40,B0C8PSMPTH,4.0 out of 5 stars Same Headphones for same price at Apple; Purchase AppleCare Plus for $29 from Apple,Amazon Customer,4,"I love my new Beats. I gave it four stars because I keep getting disconnected from my phone. I will update the rating if I figure out why and can correct the dropped calls. I will contact Apple support when I get a chance.This review is being written regarding AppleCare Plus. Huge suggestion: Buy AppleCare Plus directly from Apple for $29. Save yourself the hassle! Also, I recommend checking the price. I just purchase the Beats Studio Pro from Amazon for $179. Regular price was $349. Apple is also selling them for $179 as today, 6/16/24. I'm writing this long review I. Case it helps in regards to purchasing protection. I wanted to understand why AppleCare Plus was rate 4 stars instead of 5. I've had it and have it for several products and have always been highly satisfied. After reading nearly all of the 1-star reviews, the same message stood out- DO NOT PURCHASE APPLECARE PLUS FROM AMAZON. I decided to forgo reading the 5-star messages from approximately 64% of the customers, and just heed the message to purchase directly from Apple. Below is my experience in doing so. Again, to be fair, I cannot review the process for purchasing this plan through Amazon because I did not do so -I just wanted to avoid any hassle.I spoke with 3 different people from Apple's support team- one person via chat and two people on a phone call. All three people were extremely helpful, friendly, and made sure they did everything to help. It took nearly 45 minutes to purchase because the problem was my purchase date showed up as April 15, 2024 versus the true purchase date June 14th, 2024. The chat agency tried to change the date and it took down. Despite her efforts she was unable to change the date on her end so arrange to have someone call. A support person called, I missed the first call somehow,contacted the old chat message asking for a new call time. The support agent happened to called back anyways and the chat agent had also arranged a new call. So helpful on both ends. After speaking with the support person, he had to get additional help because again, the purchase date was not showing up. The last young lady I spoke to was able to work magic on her end and set it up where I was finally able to purchase AppleCare Plus for $29. I am highly satisfied with the support I received from Apple and I have peace of mind knowing my headphones are protected for 2 years! Next time, I will purchase products directly from Apple if the price is pretty much the same. This way, I can easily add AppleCare Plus! Had I checked before hand, I would have seen that Apple was offering the headphones for the exact same price as Amazon.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AEL3YFH2XJPGWP5J3F4I2KFB5KCA,True,2,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R1VSABWBIXFJZI,B0C8PSMPTH,3.0 out of 5 stars Overall: Disappointing,Captain Geektoid,3,"Long story short:Not what I was expecting, and returning.Long Story long:So Last year my Fiance gifted me Beats Solo3 for my B-Day. I'm someone who loves to listen to music, and had been looking for some new headphones that would accompany a pair of Monster - Inspirations I've had for the past 10 years that are still going strong. Monster, you might remember, was the first company to produce Beats before they were bought by Apple. The Solo3's were PERFECT. I know they're not the most ""Audiophile"" pair of cans on the planet, but even Sennheiser's HD 800's need some sort of DAC to make them less...Flat sounding. And hey, if you like Flat and consider yourself a true audiophile...well first, I don't know why you'd be reading a review for Beats Studio Pro, and second, I mean good for you, listening to music like it was a 1920's Phonograph.Me, I personally favor boosted everything. Bass, Mids, Highs. And the Solo 3's were, hell, still are, amazing. No full DAC required. Everytime I plug in the 3.5mm cable and listen to Lossless audio on my home server, Gosh, I mean...they sound good streaming 320kbps AAC/MP3's over bluetooth, which is what MOST OF YOU will use them for, but LOSSLESS!? It makes me wet. I'm sorry.So enter the Studio Pro's. Got these for $169 on Prime Day. Busted these babies out, put them in AAANNND...boy, they are not like the Solo3's at all. I mean, connected via Bluetooth is fine. It's fine. They're fine. Any $75 dollar headset will perform well enough over bluetooth and give you comparable noise cancelling if you're looking for that. But these, at retail NOT ON SALE, are like $350...I expect MORE from that. The other reviews gushing about these led me to believe I'd be getting MORE from that. And, again, they're fine. It's fine. But not GREAT. And for $350 I expect them to be great. For $170 I expected them to be BETTER, and they just weren't. And that's just bluetooth...when I plugged them in via the USB-C cable AND the 3.5mm jack for lossless audio...boy the performance was not there. They were so much quieter than the Solo's, and nothing was as Punchy. In fact, they sounded kind of flat. But if I wanted flat, I'd get the Sennheiser's and like a $600 DAC or other sound mix board to plug directly into. And you know, I have a DAC. It's the $65 dollar Fiio BTR3K, which is actually a very nice portable device I've used with my Solo3's and in my car to get lossless audio in my car. It performs well for what it is. So I plugged the Studio Pro's into it and they instantly sounded superior. And, y'know, I probably wouldn't mind that at all if I was listening to music 8 hours a day through the DAC and with the headphones firmly on. But I'm not, at least not enough to justify even the heavily discounted price I paid. And even with the Dac and settings, they still weren't as punchy. The Solo3's...I don't know, everytime I listen to lossless, it feels like I'm in the studio with the band, but with the Studio Pros, it feels like I'm listening to an MP3 on an iPod from 2008. That you downloaded. From Limewire. I mean, again, it's FINE, they're FINE. But shouldn't we be expecting more than FINE? Maybe it's time to bite the bullet and just invest in a Pair of the Sony XM5's or, yes, the Sennheiser HD600's or 700's or 800's with a beefy Desktop DAC if I want to increase my experience.But these...these ain't it. (Side note: They're VERY comfortable, and if Comfort is what you're after, and only comfort, you'll love these.)","Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2024",AEMWNOMHJCIKJIJK354SLZ7QZISQ,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R3SZUAME1IDBNG,B0C8PSMPTH,4.0 out of 5 stars Defective + Update,MJ,4,"I was disappointed. I received these with the speakers already blown right out of the box. They sounded like torn paper. I love Beats so I didn't understand this. I missed the return window by only one day. So I chatted with Amazon Customer Service and they issued me a refund so I can order another pair. Just wanted a replacement pair, but I will order again with the refund. Can't comment on sound quality or anything until I get my new pair. 😞Update: Amazon customer service was amazing!! Turns out that my headphones were defective when the item was received and checked. Amazon sent me the refund and I was able to buy a new pair. I am in love with the easy connection and sound. These are not audiophile type headphones, but they're great for everyday use. They do sound better on an iPhone. I tried them with my Android and though I can get Dolby Sound, the fullness just wasn't there, even with the phone's EQ. You can't use these on a device that has no sound settings, it will be horrible. That's the sacrifice when Apple took over. But on my iPhone, I set the EQ that Spotify has (if you know how to get to it), and wow! I was able to get all of the sound, including the bass I was looking for. Yes, Apple has taken away the muffled hard bass that Beats is known for and balanced it out. The EQ gives these a better and full sound. I use these with Transparency turned on and they sound just as good. ANC isn't the best but it does a decent job on the plane for me. Battery life? OMG! I only charge once every two weeks as I only use them for about 4 hours a day or so. Don't leave them charging, as with any battery, it will reduce the life of the battery. I am so happy I didn't give up on these. I traded in the black for the sandstone color and bought custom ear cushions for that original look. Upgraded from 1 star to 4 and not 5 only because of the first experience. Amazon customer service gets 5 stars! Money well spent. Thanks Amazon!!!","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AHJUGHY3J23KEAZVCTYFCHVAJY3A,True,4,Color: NavyStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R1525LERAB07PI,B0C8PSMPTH,4.0 out of 5 stars NO-ise cancellation,Bryce Underwood,4,"I have wanted a nice quality pair of over the ear headphones for quite some time now. During prime day, I saw these and decided it was worth a shot. The sound quality is really great, and the transparency mode is very clear. I am able to listen to music or my books while being able to have a conversation with family, and have complete awareness. They are quite comfortable and light as well, and I love the case! I have large ears, so they do ""stuff"" into these shallow cups. I have felt this with a lot of models I have tried on, so I wont give that against these. The only competitor that did great for size was the Apple Airpods Max, but I have not seen the best reviews on those for their price tag.But when using noise cancellation, I am very underwhelmed by it. During testing, I was on my back patio. I live on 1 acre lots, with the neighbors patio being a decent distance away. With no music on, i could hear them talking, as well as the quiet hum of the freeway that is over a mile away. I could hear my dog's nails on the concrete as they walked as well. I understand that not all ANC is meant to completely rid every noise, but I almost feel as if I should save the battery and use the mode as ""off"" with no ANC enabled. You hear more for sure, but in times I want that enabled I would rather hear next to nothing. This was with no hat or glasses on, with as much seal around my ear as possible.If ANC isn't your priority, the sound is amazing. I love the compatibility of it with my iPhone, and for the sale price I will be happy with these. I only hope as I travel on planes, the ANC will provide some help with the noise.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AHAOBBCAVRBLJFHZK5L2XDEDEBWQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R234Y6Y9SN7RW7,B0C8PSMPTH,4.0 out of 5 stars Honest Review,emmy,4,"I'll give it to you straight, as a broke college student i would NOT pay full price for these. I got them for 51% off which is a much more fair cost in my opinion.I've been wanting some good noise canceling headphones for some time now and I finally settled on spending a little more than I typically would on headphones on these.The headphones themself look very nice looks wise, I got the brown version and im very happy with the color. Id say they are a little tight on my head which gave me a little bit of a headache after short use but at least you know they wont slip.I got the app that comes with the headphones (see QR code in box) and I'd say getting the app is a MUST for full, easy function. On the app youre able to do things such as name your headphones, locate them (if lost), use noise canceling settings, etc.The noise canceling itself is the main reason I bought these. Id rate that feature a 2.5-3/5. When I turn on the feature in my app it blocked out the noise of my fan but not the TV or talking around me. It seems to only 100% block out smaller noises and quiet down the louder ones. The louder noice is significantly reduced but you can for sure still hear.In all, if you want to get these headphones, I would for sure say to wait for them to go on sale. I believe I got mine for ~180. Like I said I would NOT pay full price on these, save the money for a better usage.","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2024",AGFN7BROHOLVJARFKJQUZOHLN7SA,True,0,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I usually use AirPods but I’m tired of them falling out of my ear or hurting after so long. I saw that the beats were on sale and wanted to try it out.I love the Beats Studio pro! I use it more than I intended. When my other half is sleeping, I connect it to the Apple TV to watch without disturbing his sleep. I use it for zoom meeting, watching videos, literally everything. This is my new favorite purchase, it is so portable & fits in my purse, it has a nice, sleek appearance. It has the same changer as all my other devices USB-C which makes it convenient so that I do not have to carry around a lot of cords and it charges fast.","Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2024",AEMO5WSRLTUPPIYYRR5M35ABPESQ,True,0,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R2A90HSY4DO93A,B0C8PSMPTH,5.0 out of 5 stars These are great,jmh,5,I got these because I had a lot of travel coming up and needed quality headphones for the plane. These are fantastic. They connect perfectly with my phone and iPad - much easier than the buds I’ve tried in the past. The controls on the ear are easy to use as well. I just wish the headphones were a little tighter on my small head. I have them as small as I can get them but they still don’t sit flush on my head. This is minor for me.

Normally, I would not spend the money on these because they are expensive, but my husband bought these for me as a gift and they are the greatest gift ever. Use these normally when I go to the gym to tune out to any clinking weights and just so I can focus on my music or podcast. But the game changer is when I use these for daily chores while my kids are napping. I can still listen to music that I want, and listen to a podcast WHILE I am vacuuming and I don’t miss a thing. These are also great when my husband gets home from work and I’m trying to put dinner together together. I put these on and I can tune out the noise and the kids so I don’t go insane.

The sound quality is comparable to other headphones in their price range but I personally enjoy the noise cancellation and transparency mode on these better.

The sound quality is good and while more comfortable than the on ear style, I wouldn't want to wear these for hours.

I'd like the highest level of noise cancelation to be better. I can still hear my kids when it's on, not as well as when it's off but I expected it to be better because of the price. But I enjoy there are different setting so I can hear all background noise if I need to. Sound quality is good for me. These are lacking on bass I enjoy some bass in my music so these really didn't meet that expectation. They are a bit tight like other people have said people with a larger head or ears might find them uncomfortable but I have smaller ears and head so it's good for me. The padding around the ear piece is very soft and comfortable. The padding on the head band is giving anti slip vibes but being anti slip it does pull hair a bit but it is soft and I don't feel like they are going to slide off my head if I'm moveing around. I haven't taken a phone call with them yet. Connecting to my android was extremely simple. Overall a good value for the price especially since I bought mine on sale but if you are looking for something that drowns out the entire world when you want a moment of peace maybe go with different headphones. If you don't mind hearing some noise all the time and just wanna drown out smaller back ground noise, have a small head/ears, enjoy a little less bass then these are great for the price.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AHGBWUQCNMQ2NZBJ4ZPFFNHVNCTQ,True,2,Color: Deep BrownStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

Left earcup clicks when my jaw moves like when chewing or talking, have to make slight adjustments to where that ear cup is on my head to resolve the clicking when it happens. It is a physical issue with where the ear cup meets the band, I assume at the pivot point, causing the clicking that I’ve read many others have experienced as well.

The cushioning is a very high grade plastic which is comfortable when the headphones are being worn for hours at a time and they are secure. I wear eyeglasses and I use these headphone when I am on my laptop watching a movie or videos on Youtube. The area where the eyeglass arm rests does not hurt but my ears will get warm and I take the headphones off for a few minutes to let the air circulate at the ears to cool down, this for my use is the only negative. Otherwise these are a nice upgrade to the $60.00 or less headphones. I was able to use bluetooth to connect to my Apple devices. However, I have encountered a snag to be able to connect to my Samsung tv that is connected to a wireless soundbar which I am still investigating. In the meantime I am enjoying and glad I purchased these Beats headphone and they were marked down making them a good deal. I would recommend and give as a gift.

RZGEO464CSXFR,B0C8PSMPTH,4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing product for the price,Eric,4,"After using the best studio pros for a while, I can definitely say that these are basically the Apple AirPod max’s but for a quarter of the price which is an amazing deal for the quality of headphones you are getting.Apple owns Beats and you get most of the features as if having AirPods and the accessibility of using them with iPhones . If you have an iPhone and pair it with the Beats Studio Pros, they will automatically pop up on your phone to connect like aipods do. Some of the same features include: being able to switch transparency/noise cancellation mode through your control center on your iPhone, Spatial Audio, Apple chip, ect. It is also lighter than Apple airpod max’s which is a huge plus for staying on your head. It includes an easy control system on the left ear on the headphones to allow you to play/pause, skip/go back, volume up/volume down, accept call/end call which is nice to be able to change the volume on the headphones which is something AirPods can’t do. They are very comfortable and sort of glue to your head and ears. You can adjust the headphones to fit to your liking as well. The color ways and the matte accent makes these headphones look slick to wear and overall they took out some small Beats decals on the previous headphones to make it look clean.Some flaws I have for the headphones are 1. That when you take them off your music will not automatically pause. This makes you take a small little step in either pausing the music on your phone, through the headphones, or continuing to play the music. I like how on the AirPods they automatically pause when you take an ear bud out so I wish these headphones did the same especially when Apple owns them. 2. They could be a tad louder. Don’t get me wrong, they are overall loud headphones but you have to get over half way in the volume to notice a loud change. Below halfway seems too quiet to me personally. 3. The case it comes in is slick, but the zipper design is annoying to get the headphones in and out of the case because the zipper hole is too small. Also the case is soft shelled and not hard so it’s not as protective as I want. 4. It’s a fingerprint magnetOverall if you are looking for high quality Bluetooth headphones, these are the best bang for your buck. Yes there are some flaws to this product, but the price is too hard to beat. These easily are the same audio quality as the airpod max if not better at quarter of the price. The design of the Beats Studio Pros have a better design than the max’s so I’d definitely suggest getting these if you want to save money.","Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2024",AGNFNGIJ4UL3ZZAKLWLBZ4BGPDMQ,True,8,Color: BlackStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I end up having to either toggle back and forth between devices or listen to Spotify from my laptop. Workable, but not ideal. Additionally, there is no tone to indicate that I successfully turned on the headphones. I can’t always tell if they are on unless they pair to a device.

R3PKX54VHP9QXO,B0C8PSMPTH,4.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones,margaret juarez,4,"I haven’t own a pair of headphones this is my first pair so my review may be biased on the quality of the headphones from sound to design but I have asked people around that have own many pairs of headphones for their opinion about this set and I will be incorporating their opinion on the sound.These headphones sound very good for its price, I was looking for something that wouldn’t break the bank (I’m a broke college student), have good sound quality, and noise cancellation. I wanted something to block out the little noises and hustle and bustle when I study in the library, in a coffee shop, at home, or outside. I read a lot of reviews from different sites and watched videos about the beast pro before I committed to them. What was important for me besides the sound quality was how good the noise canceling was. Many said that for the price it was a good head set for its quality, it was equal to the the quiet comfort 45 Bose headphones.Now the sound quality in my opinion is good, I will say though that for classical and R&B music it doesn’t give it justice. You can hear the music just fine but when you are in a noisy environment, even with noise cancellation, you have to put up the volume to hear lower and softer melodies. For more up beat music the music sounds better especially like pop, rap, country, etc. There isn’t a lot of base but you can control it’s sound, you just have to have the iPhone 11 or 12 and up to do that, I have an SE 2nd gen.The opinion that I have asked of others are an overall 7/10The battery life is amazing, it last for long periods of time, for 10 hrs of music straight the battery holds to a good percentage. If I hear for a few hrs of music a day for a week, I don’t have to charge it until the next week. And it charges so quickly too, it takes up to 30 min to charge full.I like how it have its own pouch to store it in with its adapters and charger, and have an extra zipper pocket to store in anything extra.Overall these a pretty good headphones if you don’t want to spend over $300 for a pair.","Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2024",AFJACG5ME2ZWJUUIUIXBOYBEYPKQ,True,6,Color: SandstoneStyle: Studio ProSet: Without AppleCare+

RTHIK4B0U8KXP,B0C8PSMPTH,5.0 out of 5 stars Better than expected,hhoffa,5,"Everything about these are perfect so far. They cover the entirety of my ears so they don't press on the cartilage causing pain (especially since I wear glasses). They have 3 settings for sound, ""noise cancelling"", ""off"", and ""transparency"". The noise cancelling still lets sound in when nothing is playing from them, but when something is playing you can't really hear anything outside unless it's super noisy. Off makes it be just like a regular pair of headphones, and transparency is actually pretty amazing- put them on, nothing playing, and in this mode you can hear everything almost as perfectly as if you didn't have them on. When music is playing you can still hear some stuff from outside, but you still have to pause it to hear what someone is saying though.I bought an off brand pair of headphones for $25 in October and the pairing and ease of use was actually kind of complicated. BUT THESE. These are so simple, I love it. They also connected right away.My only gripe is maybe it could stay on the top of my head better, but I think that's because of how fine/thin my hair is and everything just falls off it.

R2ZXOQX9WB4BFR,B098FKXT8L,4.0 out of 5 stars I returned Sony WXM004's and got QC45's..... sooooo...... who wins?,Rich,4,"I am going to have to go with the QC45's for noise canceling but the Sony is better on sound. Much better. I am writing this review because I really struggled with which pair to buy. Ended up trying both, so I hope this helps others who are on the fence. First it is worth noting that I had to return the Sony's because they hurt my ears. There is something somewhat pointy behind the cloth and it kept pressure on my outer ear. Got really uncomfortable after wearing for 15 minutes or so. Also, there was something wrong with the Bluetooth. The sound was lacking and hollow like you were listening in a barrel. It only did this over Bluetooth, not when using the cord. For these reasons I returned them. I read all the reviews that were available on the QC45 and they all basically said the same thing. Noise canceling is awesome. Sound quality is lacking - especially the base. I can definitely confirm this is true. Having compared both headsets in the same listening conditions and same music, it is very obvious. First, the QC45 noise canceling is just better. It muted out my droning refrigerator whereas the Sony didn't quite do as well. Don't get me wrong, though, the Sony noise canceling is excellent. The QC45 is just a little better. I can also confirm the QC45 has a slight ""white noise"" sound when the room is quiet. But it does not bother me and is no worse than my previous JVC noise canceling headphones. It is actually kinda soothing. I can confirm that there is more room in the QC45s. They do not hurt my ears. I am not having the weird hollow sounding Bluetooth issues on the QC45 that I experienced with the Sony's.But when it comes to listening to music, this is where the Sony's do a much better job. I want to be clear that the issue for me is primarily the lack of base. I know I read this was an issue, but I expected that the QC45s would still have good base, and it was the brain thumping base folks who were the ones commenting it was lacking base. I suspected it might be just fine for my needs. I have to be honest here folks.... the base is just NOT there. Its just not. Not only is the base not there, the folks at Bose definitely tune these on the bright side. The treble is just a little too high for me at the volume I like to listen at. You can turn the volume down and this subsides, but that is a poor way to have to deal with headphones that are tuned just one way - bright. Bose really blew it here. The lack of base at the bright highs could have been easlily solved if I could have adjusted them via the Bose app....but no, the marketing folks had to make them look like the ""cheaper model"" compared to the 700's. Wake up Bose. Nobody likes the same kind of sound. An equalizer is an absolute must. You are and will continue to lose business on the QC45's unless you release an upgrade that allows QC45 folks to access the same type of equalizer that the 700 folks have. Just sayin......The other annoying things for me are the inability to quickly check the battery life and the music pause when you remove the headphones. The Sony's let you check battery life with a quick button push. I used this feature all the time. Not so on the QC45's. You have to log into your phone app to see this. Well this does no good when you are working on your laptop. Switching back and forth between laptop listening and phone listening was a bit more seamless and easy on the Sony's, too. The music pause that was available on the Sony's turned out to be really useful. I found myself taking the headphones on and off a lot during the work day. Pausing whatever was streaming was great. That great feature is missing on the QC45's. Overall I have to say both were great. My advice is go with the QC45 if noise canceling is most important. Go with the Sony's if the sound quality is more important.","Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2021",AEJUDTZSN23ZMIXO5YXIYRDH3O2A,True,157,Color: Black

Every. Single. One. And apparently you have to go into an app to change that, which just doesn't seem like a good idea at all - personally, I would download the app and then uninstall it, since that's not a good enough reason for me to keep the app there. But anyway. If this is a dealbreaker for you try something else. If you can deal with it, you'll probably be very happy with the headphones. This better not be removed again, there's no good reason for it. -1 star because this probably very minor flaw has become increasingly annoying and has impacted my enjoyment of this product - hopefully it won't get worse!","Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2024",AH3YOI65TK6NJB4AHVXOZJQXRCAQ,True,15,Color: Black

No matter how good a set of headphones sound, I won't wear them if they are not comfy and these are great.Sound takes a lot of getting used to. I almost returned these for the first 2 weeks. Was waiting just to see if I would ever warm up to them and I did. The way I would describe the sound is, soft but present. Not sharp, not harsh, not anything off-putting. It seems this was the focus.But for just general use, they're great. My last set were wired, and with a headphone amp they sounded A LOT better than these though they were still bose headphones. But these are just as comfy, and wireless so a ton more convenient.Wind canceling is not where I'd like it to be, seems that wasn't a focus at all.These could be 4 or 5 star depending on how you value them.

One underrated thing about noise cancellation is it allows me to listen at what I call a healthy volume, not to the max like AirPods.Battery life will typically last me 2-3 days without charging but I charge them daily. I’d say playing time on a full charge is at least 20hrs maybe more.Comfortability is great. I’ve worn these for 10hrs straight before while hopping in and out of my truck all day and never experienced any discomfort whatsoever. My girlfriend also wore them while running a 10k and said they were excellent.All in all I’m fully satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend them to anyone looking for a quality pair of noise cancelling headphones.

R16TW5XG5H4VD3,B098FKXT8L,3.0 out of 5 stars Not as good as the QC35 II,Amazon Customer,3,"This will be the third pair of Bose wireless headphones I own. I also have the QC35, QC35 II, and now the QC45.If you can believe it, all three still work. That is certainly a testament to the quality of this product line. I use one for outside work, one for my travel bag, and this one doesn’t leave my desk.Pros:- QuietComfort line are still some of the best looking, most comfortable headphones I’ve tried.- Bluetooth is excellent. Connects up to two devices and it just works.- Even better noise cancellation on the QC45s in my opinion, but at the cost of battery life. (You can adjust the NC level in the app)- Extremely comfortable pads. They are replaceable, which I have done twice on my other two pairs. Easy to do and you can pick up replacements on amazon. They last 1-2 years with everyday use.Cons:- Two different apps. For whatever reason, Bose decided to keep “Bose Connect” to control older models and introduced “Bose Music” to control the QC45s. Why?? The only thing I want to use your app for is firmware updates, settings, and maybe if I want to stream to two pairs at once. Now, we need two logins, two apps, etc.- Sound quality. I actually thought the QC35 II’s had the best sound quality. These feel like we lost mids and highs at the expense of noise cancellation and bass response.- Voice announcements. Whenever I plug this into my desktop via the 3.5 to 2.5mm cord to take a call, it takes 5-6 seconds to announce that bluetooth is off and announces what devices it disconnected from in sequence. This is really dumb, because you can’t hear anything during this time. I also prefer not to turn off voice prompts entirely because it lets you know battery level when you turn it on.- Volume override when plugged in. This one is extremely annoying. When you plug in the headphones to a jack, it overrides the system volume down to about 25% and you need to use the headphones to turn it up. I haven’t found a setting to turn this off. Come on Bose, practice some good UX and instead of deciding for the user, give them the option in the app for these “features”.- Button Mapping. Pressing the middle button to take an incoming call no longer works. Pressing the left smart button while plugged in changes the headphone from “Quiet” (noise cancelling) to “Aware” (NC off). Again, I can’t find a setting to change this in the app. A lot of these new mappings just aren’t as intuitive as the QC35 II.Things to Note:- USB C charging. Might be a good thing or a bad thing for you. I understand why they would want to make this move. Just keep in mind that the charger matters. I’ve found the charge controller can negotiate a higher voltage from bigger bricks and it will significantly cut down your charge time.- I don’t use Alexa/Google assistant so I can’t speak to its efficacy.- They make an sound when turned on that reminds me of the THX trademark.Overall, there are too many things on the QC45’s that make them frustrating for me. They took an excellent product and tried to add a few features at the expense of a great experience for an intuitive product that just worked. With the QC45, I find myself thinking about its limitations on what I’m about to do vs just turning them on and using them without having to think about it.TL;DR - Skip these and pick up the QC35 II’s on sale. They are excellent and are still the ones I use primarily.","Reviewed in the United States March 23, 2022",AGGOZLYEN3YQNUOQRWPCFSDW65GQ,True,86,Color: Black

The only complaint is that the on/off switch may develop a problem over time. Bose should have the switch recessed and a bit beefier so that it will not be damaged when the storage case is squeezed. There are vids on YouTube showing how to repair this situation and it helps if you, or a friend, have an electronics repair background. Because of the switch design and price, I give a seemingly 5 star product a 4.","Reviewed in the United States March 19, 2024",AFJZU7OOUUWFZUAAFAFGCZC4FTTQ,True,1,Color: Black
R2YET1L41NBJML,B098FKXT8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Noise cancellation can't be beat!!!,B. Ralston,5,"Bose used to be the best in sound. Over the years others have caught up and they're not as superior as they once were. But then they figured out noise cancellation, and let me tell you nothing else comes close! In Quiet mode, I can't hear the tv that is 6 feet away from me, I can't hear the loud network cabinet behind me at work, and I didn't know there was a baby screaming on the airplane until I took them off! I was using Beats at work which are supposed to be ""almost"" as good but in reality the difference is night and day. If you want to shut out the world around you, these are what you need! Then there's Aware mode - now it sounds like you're not wearing headphones at all. It perfectly replicates the sounds around you so you can hear everything that is going on and hold a normal conversation while listening to your music or movie or game. And they are so light and comfortable! They don't weigh heavy on your head like other headphones, and the cup is shaped so it doesn't touch or press on your ear and become painful with extended use. I bought one set of these for the house on Prime day, and love them so much I bought a second set on Black Friday for work. I've had them for 5 months so far and they're holding up great, still in great shape. I can't recommend these enough!","Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2023",AECCVGNGYQ7NKV5MCC7MKHKBP4SA,True,5,Color: Black

I call this minor for me because 95% of the time, I use these headphones on the iphone anyway. I tried to fix the issue by only connecting 1 device on bluetooth at a time, and reconnecting but nothing fixed it.But based on just how fantastic these headphones perform on a plane, in a crowd, outside, and laying on the couch, I really cannot fault them much.

R2TUGCN97QZGHI,B098FKXT8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful!,Sarah Blake LaRose,5,"I am trying to give here the kind of info I would have wanted while shopping. In addition to looking for headphones that meet my audio needs, I am also blind and wanted a good description since I could not see the photos.I have been a Bose user for many years, first wired headphones, then SoundLink,, then bought the QC 35 for my stepdaughter and then the NC700 for myself. I replaced my NC 700 headphones with QuietComfort 45 and I am quite happy.The QC 45 are over-ear headphones (cups that fit over the entire ear). The band goes over your head and the part that touches your head is rubbery in texture, not slick like the NC 700. This is a definite improvement. It retains the noise cancelling ability but the headset won't fly off your head if you move quickly.The controls for the QC45 are all buttons and switches--a huge plus! I won't be accidentally hanging up on people or anything else. Also, blind people hate the touch controls. Thank you, Bose, for bringing back the buttons!The Bose Music app is also much improved! There are no more unlabeled buttons! In the app, the tips are very descriptive and will provide all the help one needs to know which controls do what. If you have owned the old Soundlink model, the controls are exactly the same.These headphones fold just like the old Soundlink model. This is also a major advantage for me over the NC700.I have found the sound quality to be improved over the NC 700. I should say that I have a hearing loss and I may simply prefer this headset to the other. I think the NC 700 may be better at producing base, so keep this in mind if you have a strong preference for particular sound quality. On the other hand it is also possible to change the settings via the EQ in the music app.Some reviews are mentioning a radio-type sound. This happened when I tried to pair with a PC, specifically if I tried connecting to ""headset"" instead of ""headphones"". I have paired with my phone through the music app first, then had the music app place the headphones in pairing mode and set my PC to search for devices. I am having no trouble with sound quality.The only thing I personally wish is that these were on-ear headphones. I don't actually like over-ear products but I also don't like earbuds. It's not something to mark them down for, just a personal preference.","Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2022",AHHXKBOEZV4MRFK5GSQ6S4O4VNDQ,True,35,Color: Black
R3TCLYAHJKDMCK,B098FKXT8L,"4.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable, great sound, some minor annoyances",D. Thole,4,"I've had the QC45s for about a month. I got them because my roommate has had a pair of QC35 IIs for many years, and I wanted a pair of my own and wanted to see if the reality was as bad as some of the reviews.Overall, the negative reviews are a bit exaggerated - I think these are great headphones. Super comfortable, great noise cancellation, pretty solid battery life. The ability to edit the quality of the sound in the app (more/less bass, treble, middle, etc) is really nice and has made a noticeable difference in the quality. Based on what I've read, this was a very recent addition to the QC45s and was much needed.However, there are a couple of issues.One of the most annoying things that was proven TRUE from the negative reviews is this: whenever I'm connected to both my laptop and my phone, if I'm listening to my laptop audio through the QC45s, there are little lapses/missteps in audio every couple of minutes. They are quick, but they are annoyingly noticeable because they are frequent. And this is a consistent problem. THE SOLUTION is to disconnect your phone through the Bose Music app if you plan to use your computer audio for the day (i.e. a long workday). If you disconnect your phone, you'll eventually have to reconnect (of course), but it will stay connected to your laptop and the audio has been perfect with this strategy. Small, but annoying nonetheless.Another thing: it's not easy to switch between the laptop and the phone audio through the Bose Music app. It seems like my laptop takes 'precedence' when I turn on the headset (it remembers both), so if I want to switch to my phone audio, I have to go into the app and turn off the laptop connection manually. I wish the headset was more intuitive/there was a quicker way to change.Sound quality is very comparable to the QC35 IIs (perhaps because of the ability to manually edit the different levels of sound in the app), just as comfortable, and honestly look a lot better.TLDR; I think these are bit overhated, I've liked them and look forward to continuing to use them (and hopefully to Bose continuing to update them and improve the QOL and usage). I do agree that if you don't care about the aesthetic (QC45 looks much better than QC 35 II in my opinion), you would have a very similar experience with both of these.","Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2022",AGRSAALR66ELJUM7BJADDB7B2KNA,True,60,Color: Black
R3JLRG1UFJKUE1,B098FKXT8L,4.0 out of 5 stars DOA....,CommGuy,4,"I bought this item to replace an aging QC35 headset. However, this item was DOA (Dead On Arrival). It wouldn't take a charge nor power up. After leaving it on a charger, I got the dreaded amber/white flashing light. After trying to contact Bose via their customer support, an automated message directed me to return it for a replacement. I was also notified that it can take up to 4 weeks to send me a replacement. WTF! I would think such a well known and reputable company would at least send out a replacement as soon as they got confirmation that the broken set was shipped (they did provide me a UPS shipping label). I would also expect that their QA would have caught a non-functioning unit BEFORE it ships out. With this pricepoint, I guess I was expecting too much. I'll update this review once I get a replacement......**** UPDATE *****After nearly a month later, I received my replacement. Though I'm still not entirely satisfied with the return process as a whole, the headphones themselves are definitely top notch. The sound quality seems much better quality than my previous QC35's. The noise canceling seems superb as well. One feature I really like is that if you use the cord, you can still use the headphones without turning it on. Obvisously you won't have any noise cancellation, but if you are looking to save battery life, this is a great option. My only complaint concerns both the recharging cable and the wired headset cords provided. The carging cable is way too short. At least its a standard USB-A to USB-C cable so aftermarket cables should be easy to find. However, the headset cable also is a tad short. The other issue is that it is not a standard 3.5mm plug cable. Bose for some reason decided to use the smaller and rare 2.1mm plug on the headphones side and the ""standard"" 3.5mm plug on the other. This makes this a ""Unique"" cable so if you happen to lose it, you'll be out of luck until you can source another.","Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2023",AG3QA2OOOXL4E46I7RWO6LLMJC5A,True,33,Color: Black

The other problem I had with 1000XM4 is constant need to turn off their speech to sound technology where the music or podcast stops if there is any word said around you. And guess what? Even if you turn it off, it'll come back on the next day. These Bose headphones have NONE of those issues. They're lighter, do the same job and are way better imo.

They are also a 5 for being lightweight for an active, noise cancelling headphone. Battery life also seems to be 5.The noise cancellation is a 4.5. Nothing comes close to the Apple Airpods Max in this respect. I use a very loud vacuum cleaner and these Bose reduce the noise I hear quite well, but not nearly as hushed as the Apple.I'd give the sound quality a 4. It's very good, and I'm comparing the sound not only to other wireless Bluetooth headphones, but also to the best TOTL headphones costing 20 times what these cost, such as the TOTL Stax electrostatics. Among active noise cancelling bluetooth phones, the PSB M4U 9 reign supreme in sound quality, but are not nearly as comfortable and are much heavier and less compact.In quiet environments you can hear that the active electronics of these produce a bit of audible hiss through the earphones. This is not annoying or even audible at reasonable listening levels, however, so I don't downgrade the sound for that. The sound quality is natural enough to satisfy me, especially for the price, and I'm picky about sound quality. These have fine bass. The midbass is just a tad excessive. The midrange is fine, very natural sounding. The upper two octaves are a bit down in level, but that is preferable to bright and screechy which so many headphones are.","Reviewed in the United States August 19, 2023",AHQGITIO5PSVA2UHNKGCQTD3UYLQ,True,30,Color: Black

They’re amazing all the way around. But one thing I wanted to shine a spotlight on is the noise cancelling. It blew me and everyone I showed to away.Little backstorySound is something I’m very sensitive to, ever since I was a kid. If I’m focusing on something and somebody makes a noise it completely distracts me. Last year me and my partner got an apartment and the noise from neighbors has always been a problem. It wasn’t even that it was loud or they were rude. An occasional bump or laugh and it completely sent me into a mild panic because now I’m hyper focused on that and when it will happen again. I couldn’t sleep at night. I was becoming depressed and anxious. I loved our place and I knew it was just me being the way I am and nothing else. I tried everything, Received Air Pods for my birthday and I was using those for awhile but I knew it couldn’t be good to keep plugs in my ears so much like that. Well I found these and with skepticism I bought them and all I can say is wow. Not to be dramatic but this may have saved my lifeIf you’re looking for something to block out sound then the noise cancellation on these headphones are it! With a press of a conveniently placed button you can switch from Aware Mode to Quiet Mode without skipping a beat on what you’re listening to.Literally I can snap in front of my face and not hear it when listening to something mildly loud. Completely blocks noise from TV’s and small bumps from neighbors. If you’re in any way hesitant about how well this feature works please don’t be.

R2YI09MR9HTIXR,B098FKXT8L,2.0 out of 5 stars Skip these and go for the 700,NS,2,"The good, the bad, and the ugly:The good - Comfort!!! These are the most comfortable headphones I have worn, they beat out the Bose 700 by miles when it comes to comfort. The noise cancellation on these is also amazing. I did end up returning these and compared to the 700, I feel these were stronger at canceling noise. BUT if white noise bothers you, skip on these because you can definitely hear the ""sound"" of a speaker being turned on even when the ANC is on by itself. It is sort of a white noise/fuzzy sound. It didn't bother me at all. I like white nose and it really drowned out the background noise. I suggest reading reviews on how noise cancellation works, because anyone saying they can not hear someone yelling at them is lying or had their music turned all the way up. It muffles sound very well, but doesn't ""cancel"" it. They pair easily and work with my iPhone, Samsung TV, and LG TV. Reviews I read on the Sony MX4 say they do not pair well with Samsung TVs, which is why I chose Bose.The bad - The range on these paired with my LG TV was severely lacking. It crackled on and off at maybe 12 feet distance. Which is about the distance from me sitting up in my bed to the TV on the wall. It would work fine for awhile, then crackle. I purchased the Bose 700 next and they do not have this issue. Also, when music or the TV is playing with the noise canceling on, the sound is muffled and I have to turn it up quite a bit more than when the noise cancelling is not on. Obviously the other sounds are muffled as well, so you don't have to battle with the distractions.The ugly - These are headphones from a very reputable company, yet they fail at the #1 job they have. Everything played through them sounds awful. It is like everything you listen to is in a tin can. I listen to every kind of music - from classical to hip hop to Christian to rock and pretty much everything in between. All of them sounded bad, and the worst of the worst were things that were recorded live. Also, if you like bass, move on, even with the EQ software - these are severely lacking in bass. Any reviews saying the EQ options ""fix"" the sound are off base. It improves it, which there is a LOT of room for improvement, but it doesn't fix it.I am not a musician, but I do enjoy good music. So I would say that most people will be able to hear the difference in quality between these and another set of headphones. I returned these and went with the Bose 700. The 700s sound like a high quality pair of headphones should sound. Any reviews comparing the QC 45 to the Sony MX4 should be taken with a grain of salt, because it isn't that Sony is that much better - these QC 45s are just awful. I would suggest reading the Sound Guy's review on noise cancelling headphones, it was helpful for my choice. They rated Sony MX4 on the top of their noise cancelling headphone list with the Bose 700s coming in second. The Sony MX4 were rated higher, but according to their reviews, they broke easily and the warranty was useless for that. The QC45 didn't even make the list, but they do have a review for them separately.If you do go with these headphones, I would strongly suggest listening to multiple kinds of music and television through them. Then try them next day in the morning when it is quiet. It took until the second day for me to really realize how horrible music sounded on them. I compared them to a $15 set of over-the-ear bluetooth headphones that I purchased for the gym and the cheap set sounded way better! Of course, my cheap pair doesn't cancel noise the way the Bose do, but I want both good sound AND noise cancellation and they QC45 does not provide both.","Reviewed in the United States March 30, 2022",AE3VAIRXK3ED3OCD6RIEYI4IZD5A,True,3,Color: Black

AMAZING SOUND! I was hooked! Fast forward -- 34 years later thousands of dollars and a plethora of BOSE products purchased through the years, given as gifts and more....I am SORELY disappointed that I shelled out $370 in April of 2023 to purchase the Quiet Comfort 35II and instead received the Quite Comfort 45. OK - I accepted it -- I liked that I could pair two devices. Moved on. Now here is it August 2023 only 5 SHORT months later and those headphones just ""died"" - wont charge, wont' work - nothing. Understand, I am the Director of Operations of a company - when I say I use these headphones no less than 8 to 10 hours a day I am not exaggerating! Desperate to get them working again - I troubleshot, contacted Bose - zero response and zero assistance. Contacted Amazon - also, ZERO response. I could not wait - I needed a new set ""now"" like ""yesterday"" for work. I ordered another pair - shelled out another $300 bucks to get the new pair - came overnight - all working well. But, I REALLY expected more from BOSE - this is crazy to spend this much money and receive ZERO support? ZERO option for return? ZERO option for repair? I pray the Bose Smart Sound bar 900 that I literally just purchased ( elsewhere due to no response from Bose on Amazon ) and hooked up in my living room does NOT disappoint -- ( yes another $700 for BOSE ) and I pray these new headphones last.

R3V2GTTBE5U4XD,B098FKXT8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Better than Quiet Comfort 35 ii,Trueepower,5,"I was hesistant to purchase the new 45's after reading the reviews. After years of using Quiet Comfort 35 ii's, I can safely say these have better sound quality. No doubt about it, using these back to back with a pair of 35's, these were significantly better. Were they massive better? I would say easily better sound, not massively better sound. With the high's of the 45's you hear more, you here more sound, more crisp highs, and that's where the difference is. Bass was the same between the two headphones, the difference is the highs.The quality of the head phones is a bit better all around too, better buttons, better head cushion, no Bose emblem to damage or rub off. Bluetooth 5.1 way way better than 4.0. I can listen to these headphones from severall rooms away, in comparison, 35's are not reliable from only 15 to 20 feet away.Even if everything with the 35's and 45's were equal (which they are not), the bluetooh 5.1 is massive upgrade over 4.0. Only negative, is using two devices at once, I have some problems with the headphones from transitioning to one device to the next. That's possibly because other devices I am using are not bluetooth 5.1 (but are 4.0). That's really the only negative about these headphones. Easily forgiven, since everything else on these headphones is superior. Also, USB C, much faster charging is nice, easy to connect over mini USB. Noise canceling is way way better. Cannot even hear a person next to you when listening to music at a decent volume level. Bravo Bose, Bravo!!!I was highly skeptical at first, wasn't going to purchase... Glad I did. Highly recommend over 35 ii's, worth the extra money easily. I couldn't even go back to the 35's after using these.","Reviewed in the United States May 18, 2022",AEPTHR5LT2A2ELROF4CKNECGAL4A,True,9,Color: Black

They're comfortable, as well. 5 1/2 hour flight, and they felt comfortable the entire time.I've used the headphones for different types of music (jazz, rock, classical) and for movies, and I found the sound quality to be excellent. I suppose the higher-priced headphones might have even better sound quality but, for the price, these headphones are a tremendous value.NOTE: I haven't used them for phone calls yet, and probably won't.

R34JB77UOZQ0SP,B098FKXT8L,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Sound Quality but Noise cancellation is not as effective,Jay Ocean,4,"First and foremost, I bought this Bose headphones because I wanted something to cancel loud noise effectively, whether that is construction, loud people outside, noisy apartment dwellings, etc. Even though there seems to be alot of positive reviews stating the efficacy of these headphones' noise cancellation, I didn't find it too effective. If anything, the control that allows it to create noise cancellation responsive to the sounds of the background was good but not great. This works well in the library, cancelling out whispers, small background noise, buzzes, and regular conversation noise levels, but if you are talking about very loud banging, construction, apartment dwellings where you have heavy stomping upstairs above you, this does not cancel 100%. At most it cancels 50%. Even with white noise playing in the background with these headphones, it is impossible to cancel out loud, inconsistent noises. On the positive side, the sound quality and bass quality of the headphones are excellent. I enjoyed listening to music on it. The headphones are not very comfortable to wear at night for sleep if you are looking for sleep cancelling headphones. It is quite bulky and heavy just like the SONY headphones. If you really want the most bang out of your buck for noise cancellation, get ear plugs! Hope this review helps for anyone seriously considering buying these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States April 24, 2023",AH6OQRHQQKV3CKR4EUZZEWCA3BCQ,True,20,Color: Black

I particularly like how they fold up to fit in small spaces, like luggage. However, these QC45s are not as good as the QC35 in the past. They look identical, except the QC45 has L and R printed on the insider of each earmuff. The problems are the battery doesn't last as long, and it takes twice as long (11 sec vs. 5 sec) to boot up and connect to your device. The noise cancelling is excellent, matching the QC35 performance. Sony is known for good noise cancelling, the QC45 excels with that. Would I buy them again? Yes, but I'd recommend to buy the QC35 model if you can find them. It's better. This is a case where Bose failed to improve the newest model, reducing the performance for boot time and battery life.

Doesn't sweat or get hot or sit on your ears like the sony one. Also the issue with Sony is after few months the noice cancelling mode stops working. It makes the LOUDEST ringing sound ever and you will go deaf from it. That's why I switched to Bose and I'm very happy I did. Also the Bluetooth range is awesome.

R22P7GYTRE2RAU,B098FKXT8L,5.0 out of 5 stars Bose QC headphones are the iPhone of headphones,Robert S,5,"In the past few years, I have owned and used all of the Sony headphones, from the MDR-1000X all the way to the XM4s. Before that, I used the Bose QC35s. The reason I initially switched to Sony and became a Sony fan was because of the sound profile on the Sonys. I found the music more punchy and fun to listen to. Fast forward to last year, when I needed another good pair of headphones for work and saw that Bose was coming out with another QC model. Even though I was a Sony fan, I did remember that the QC35s were much more comfortable than the Sonys, so I decided to get the QC45s because I knew I'd be wearing them most of the day for work. A year later, I now exclusively use the QC45s for everything: work calls, podcasts, music, audiobooks, etc. and my Sony XM4s remain in the case.So reason why I state in my headline that these are the iPhone of NC headphones is because I really don't picture myself upgrading these for at least another year or two because they meet every need I have when it come to NC headphones and are built solidly and well, kind of like the iPhone. When I used Android, I upgraded every year, but when I switched to iPhone, that stopped. I still have my iPhone 12.In conclusion, these headphones are the best choice for those who really just want a solid pair of headphones. Even music sounds great on them (especially if you use the EQ on the Bose app)--maybe not as good as Sony, but close. Now if you are an audiophile and really want the best sound and features and don't care the most about comfort, Sony or another high-end brand would be better.","Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2021",AFQJYKVK4T7BVDRBS7SOXJTEQPSA,True,5,Color: Black

ROM7R6LU1GPJJ,B098FKXT8L,1.0 out of 5 stars UPDATE: Amazon shipping used ones as new; buy at Best Buy instead,Anonymous,1,"UPDATE 2023/11/17: Ordered a second pair and Amazon (shipped and sold directly by them) is advertising new headphones but sending used ones instead. Best Buy has them for the same price. I was able to tell they were used by the unsealed packaging, the battery level being 100%, and the welcome message when turning on the headphones: ""Connecting to Katy's iPhone"".Original Headline: Not perfect, but the best wireless ANC headphones I could findTAKEAWAYThere's still a lot of room for improvement in these headphones, but being able to wear them for hours with minimal discomfort makes them far more useful than headphones that are painful to wear. They are presently the only option I've been able to find on the market that I can wear relatively comfortably, so I'm keeping them. If you have large ears, these are the headphones for you. By the way, I found the QC45s to be more comfortable than the previous QC35 II model I tried on in a store.COMFORTI spent a long time trying to find true circumaural wireless ANC headphones in the up-to-$500 range and tried a number of pairs on, including the Bose QC35 II headphones. While the Bose QC45 headphones aren't completely circumaural, the deeper ear cups allow ears to fold into them with far less discomfort than other headphones I've tried. Bose care enough about comfort to put it in the product name and they deliver pretty well on this. The only improvement I'd make to the fit is to have slightly larger openings in the ear pads for a true circumaural fit.ACTIVE NOISE CANCELLATION (ANC)This is my first pair of ANC headphones and the ANC wowed me. The dome of silence is incredible in ""Quiet"" mode. The ANC drowns out a lot of background noise, especially if voices are in another room. Voices/TV/radio in the same room isn't as good, but still better than nothing at all. Road noise in the car is considerably reduced. Airplane background noise is still audible, but significantly reduced, except they crackle and pop loudly for about 10 to 30 seconds on take-off and landing. I think it's just too much for the ANC to keep up with. I do wish there was a way to turn off ANC altogether (to preserve battery life, for instance), but that's only possible in wired mode. The ""Aware"" mode seems to not be useful for listening to music in, as it seems to amplify outside sounds obnoxiously. For that reason, it would be nice if turning on ""Aware"" mode automatically paused the music and resumed it when switching back to ""Quiet"" mode.SOUND QUALITYI wasn't blown away by the sound quality. It is certainly better than my old $40 pair of wireless headphones, but the sound isn't as full and rich as I would expect from Bose. It came off a bit tinny at times, especially when listening to harder rock music. Just a tad more bass would be appreciated. Being able to set at least the treble and bass myself would be better yet. These also lack support for the aptX codec.BATTERYThe battery life is good, but I wouldn't call it great. A 15-minute fast-charging feature like the Master & Dynamic MW65s would be awesome. Having a standard USB-C port for charging is nice, though, so I don't have to bring a special cable or adapter with me when I travel. The prevalence of USB ports on planes is helpful but, annoyingly, you can't charge the headphones and listen to them at the same time.DESIGNThe design of these is pretty boring, but it is serviceable. All the hinges that make it comfortable and fold up compact make the headphones feel a bit flimsy in hand, but the build quality feels good when they are in place on my head, and they are light enough to wear for hours at a time with minimal discomfort (due to the ear cups not being quite large enough). The carrying case is great and the fact that it is included makes the value of these headphones even better.","Reviewed in the United States December 16, 2021",AEIFZBU5I6RRIQETYZPAYHKY74SA,True,29,Color: Black

I use it mostly at the office to increase my focus and block surrounding noises.The headset is easy to pair with devices and has the ability to connect to multiple devices at the same time and the connection switching is seamless.There is no noticeable delay between the source and the sound on the headset. For example, if the headset is connected to your phone and you are watching videos, there is no delay between the source of the video (your phone) and the audio playing on the headset. So, the Bluetooth connection is very fast.The headset is very comfortable even after using them for long hours. The cushions are soft and the overall texture and quality feel premium.The only take is that the noise cancellation could be better. For example, the mics are not good at picking and canceling noises from all directions. For example, there are some angles that the mics do not catch the noise from and some of that noise can sometimes seep through. To be fair, these minor noises are really hard to notice but a higher quality of noise cancellation is always expected from such a premium item.","Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2023",AEDW5ELGWNAJX2B2AJNH5YH5TMUA,True,11,Color: Black

It has perfect noise cancellation (really dangerous if you wear it in the street, as you might not be aware of traffic around you.). Its folding is a bit unintuitive, but it is ok.Earcups surround your ear perfectly. This is excellent for noise cancellation, but is really annoying if your ears sweat a lot. I understand that there are replacement earcups sold, but I was told by a friend (who owns these headphones) that it would take me long before I need to buy them.Regarding its controls, I like them. They are simple and easy to understand. The best part for me is that it is not touch-activated (previously, I had headphones with this functionality and they made me crazy because they would turn the music on and off by any accidental touch).Update: there is a use case that I stumbled in recently: if you connect it to your laptop using the 3.5mm wire, and activate the noise suppression, the audio gets lower significantly. I don't know the reason for that, but I know that for over $250 a piece, the manufacturer should have discovered that bug with proper testing, and found a solution.","Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2023",AGU3ONA6MNEDDQD7SFWRSHQZWGZQ,True,13,Color: Black

RWYPBHJ3T7F5I,B091FZK6VB,4.0 out of 5 stars Not Sure How I Feel About It,Brittney,4,I am basing this review off of coming from a JBL Live 650BTNC. In terms of that lets get started Between the 2 I feel like the comfort level of ear pads is better with the 650. My ear rests right up against the headphones transducers on each ear. So not sure if that's just less padded on this model versus the 650. But I definitely couldn't feel that transducer right up against my ear in the 650. Overall for comfort my win for that is the 650.Now I'm going to move onto the bluetooth range. The overall winner here is this 660. I am a janitor and don't like carrying my phone on me in fear of dropping it or loosing it. So I can easily leave my phone on a table in an office and walk around a whole floor without loosing connection to my phone.As far as battery goes. I haven't really seen a big difference between either of the headphones. I still get about 4 days worth of listening with an average of 6hrs of use per day. So both headphones are about even there for me.Moving right along to the noise cancelling. I can honestly say that I like the 650 better for noise cancelling. As a janitor I am often running loud vacuums or carpet cleaners. And with the 650 I could barely hear either of the machines. Now maybe I haven't gotten my custom settings right with the equalizer in the JBL app yet for the 660. But I can still very much hear those machines.Now onto the features. I'm going to give this win to the 660. I love the idea that when I remove an ear pad from my ear to talk to a coworker or my boss the music of whatever music service I am listening (including YouTube) the music stops. And starts playing again the second I place it back on my ear. This comes really handy when I'm listening to an audiobook or podcast.And last volume wise. I am going to give the 650 the win for this. I didn't have to have my volume up as high with those headphones as I did with the 660. But in terms of overall quality to the audio. There isn't a difference that I can tell.With that said. I have only had these headphones for about a week. If anything changes. I'll update this review. But for now I'd say these headphones overall are pretty good. But if I didn't want the longer bluetooth range for work I would not have bought these. I would've stuck it out with the 650. But I didn't like the idea of carrying my phone with me from section to section on each floor. And then forgetting where I laid it.,"Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023",AHLBINEKSWQ3Z5KGV6RTV26OPRJQ,True,2,Color: Blue

R30ZILB2BOTAD9,B091FZK6VB,"4.0 out of 5 stars Its good, but not great",aleqsandre,4,"Honest review: been testing this for 2 days now. Starting with package. Nothing too special came with manual, charger, aux cable and bag. Charger is very short i dont like it. They use some kind of mini aux to aux cable so if you damage this or lose it it will be very hard for you to find cable like this. Cable itself is good quality tho, braided. Bag was nothing too fancy, very cheap material. About headphone itself. Build quality is normal. It doesnt feel cheap but it doesnt feel premium either. One thing that i really dislike is material. It attracts hand oils and fingerprints really really easily. Like when you touch this thing even once, your whole fingerprints are already there. If someone has very sweaty hands it will be problem for you. It gets dirty very easily. Comfortwise, i wouldn't say that its very comfortable. When i first wore it, clamping force was too much for me and after 5 minutes i got headache, but overtime i got used to it. now I can wear it 2-3 hours without any discomfort. So not the most comfortable headphone either. Ear cups are fine. My ears are more on the bigger side and it covers them fne. Now lets talk about sound quality and features. One of the main feature that this headphone has is ANC. I really like ANC here, I dont care what anyone else says. For 150$ of course you are not going to get Sony level ANC but this are just fine. For this money i think they are really good. It also has awareness mode, wich makes your surroundings more noisy, that way you can still hear everything around you. Mobile app is very easy to navigate and self explanatory, nothing too fancy. Sound itself is good-ish. Dont get me wrong, it doesnt sound bad by any means but even i can hear some muddy base here and there (Im not an audiophile). So one thing that i noticed is that it cant really get those low bass really good. Sometimes there is this weird shaky noises on bass kicks. I thought it had deffect at first but You need to adjust ear cups in a way that it completely seals your ears, otherwise those weird low bass sounds start. If you want headphones for bass music i wouldnt reccomend these. This is for for people who enjoy hiphop or jazz. Mids and trebbles are on point, no concernes there. Overall i would give this headphones 7/10. i take 3 points away because of bad material wich attracts fingerprints, okay-ish comfort and muddy bass. For 150$ i think this is great. Another option i would also look at in this price range is Anker soundcore space Q45. Make decision between these 2 models and pick whichever fits you the best. Both are great headphones for the money.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2023",AFR4HCN6NHESKHUAL6ZE4CR4YYEA,True,40,Color: Black

I've got to say that I believe that those were better than this more expensive brand.The noise canceling on the JBL is better. However, anytime there is even the slightest amount of wind, it blows right through and you have to turn the volume up to almost a deafening level.Also, anytime you walk around in these the sound reverberates and causes this weird echo into the headphones which is very annoying. Same thing with eating or movement.Would I say that they're worth it? They're good headphones, but not for the price they're charging.

RIN3UHM8H5KNZ,B091FZK6VB,3.0 out of 5 stars Average,InternetToughGuy,3,"This is just an OK set of Bluetooth headphone for the price and from the name brand. They're convenient, have decent battery life, and have a nice interface and are pretty comfortable, but that's probably the extent of the positives.They don't get very loud, which is safe, but cranking the volume on my phone is not really pushing these things. Sound quality is average - I know you can mess with the EQ, but set on flat these things are still a bit unablanced. Bass end is a bit dull and too muddy on the bass end - not overly boomy (unless you adjust EQ to boost it even more) but not super defined. If you try to push the volume then it seems to favor the top end more and can get shrill without EQing. Leaves more to be desired.It has a feature that pauses/turns the audio off when you take them off your head, which is cool, but it will improperly trigger and cut out if you try to move the head band around or wear it in a position to not mess up/dent your hair or if you want to slip one off your ear. You can toggle this feature with the app, but kinda becomes useless at that point.They are OK at what seems to be an always discounted price. Otherwise I would consider saving a little more for a nicer set or get a higher quality studio wired set for roughly the same price as these.","Reviewed in the United States March 30, 2024",AH2CGRCAWUZSMU4SUZZE5FKONSVQ,True,1,Color: Black

After a while of regular wearing/use, I noticed that the headphones were detecting that they were no longer on my head even though they still were and therefore continued to turn off my music/pause my videos.

You can only have one of the last two features toggled on in the app along with NC. There are extra features that kinda feel gimmicky like the auto play/pause feature ( headphones pause and play music if they detect you’re wearing them or not) I turned this feature off and if you press down on the left speaker for 2 seconds, you can activate your assistant.Lastly and the most important talking point about these headphones is the sound quality, I wish they got louder than they did, they sounded kinda lower on max volume the my tune headphones, even the bass sounded kinda lacking compared to them, but there is a solution but that’s only if you download the app and mess with the EQ settings, I recommend the club preset because it makes the bass pop and not sound muddy while you can hear crisp vocals that aren’t drowned out by the bass, and the volume feels increased because of this preset, and the last thing that make these sound like 200 headphones depends on the music app you use. I personally use Musi (iPhone exclusive) and their bass preset plus the JBL app club preset make these sound AMAZING, even better than Spotify, but I digress these headphones are really good pickup, but only on if they’re on sale. I got these for $99.95 USD but I don’t feel these headphones are worth $199.95 because of the after mentioned sound quality out of the box, I would market these at about 160-170, but JBL headphones are really good so this gets 4 stars from me.","Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2022",AGKLFLVJGFQN4ZMMXPPNDNLD6NJQ,True,31,Color: Black

I wanted to see the difference from all the other ""cheap ones"" and honestly I wasn't missing much. I had Sony before this and it was trash. Absolutely trash. Probably the type I got, but I was disappointed.Anyways, the only thing I really like about this one is the band. It's not plastic. It's like a clothed material. It'll avoid scratches. It's also tight on the ears. I jumped and did some planks on it to see how It'll be when I go to the gym and it stayed on so far.It does hurt my ears and starts hurting few minutes after wearing, so I probably won't be wearing it too much or may have to get used to it or return it with other circumstances. I have the akg earphones that came with my Samsung phone and it's great. No going extra length to turn on noise cancelling. You can tell by just putting it on. It's just that it's wired, so it does cause some problems during workouts or other activities, which is why I'm looking for wireless.Back to this, I've had to turn the volume really loud to hear and enjoy my music unlike some headphones you can hear loud and clear at low volume. No base until you turn on noise cancelation and it's hardly there. Never cared about base before, but all the talk about base on these headphones got me wondering and nothing. Like I said, hardly missing much with the other ""cheap"" unpopular brands out there.I'm thinking of returning, but I do like how it's not falling while I workout. That and the band design. Everything else can be found on cheaper headphones. Will return if I find those two things on a cheaper headphones because why pay more for something I can get at a lower price?...Idk much about battery life yet. Sorry to disappoint if you needed that. Just charged it and started using.It was at 70% when I opened and tested it. Charged it and officially started using it about an hour plus ago and it's still at 100%. I don't remember how long it took to charge, but it wasn't that long.","Reviewed in the United States October 11, 2021",AGQMAATGONMWXDDJXFC7DIM423RQ,True,25,Color: Blue

A song I’ve heard a thousand times suddenly had backup singing I’d never noticed before these. I’ve had these now for a couple of weeks, have used them for several hours overall and haven’t charged them since I first got them. Most earbuds don’t fit me and those that do get uncomfortable within about 60-90 minutes and I tried a pair of over-the-ear Beats Studio headphones before these and they hurt after an hour as well - these JBLs haven’t bothered my ears at all, even wearing them for 3+ hours at a time.

However, after using for a little while, I can confirm they are pretty comfortable.The noise cancelation are pretty good if you want it for that. I believe one of the buttons allows you to adjust the levels of noise cancelation, I turned it down a bit.The sound is good, no complaints there.Overall I like them, I usually wear gaming headphones, but I wanted something I can just lay in bed and watch videos with.1 things to note before buying: If you are like me and don't want to worry about charging, you do need an adaptor (comes with wire, not usb-c) for the phones these days. (The battery life I have not tested yet, I'm sure its good)I'd recommend them, def if you can get them on sale.","Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2023",AEOASDPJJ23QZ5MN2UUELM3DU6RA,True,0,Color: White

R2H22DVHB4C2A8,B091FZK6VB,4.0 out of 5 stars Great for the price point.,IBrown,4,"Sound cancelling isn't as good at the flagship Sony (which have surpassed Bose at this point), and sound quality isn't as good as flagship Sennheiser. That's okay because these cost way less and the sound cancelling and sound quality are still pretty good. You can still feel the base from Massive Attack's ""Angel"" and you can still reduce the noise on a plane and they're a ton better than anything else in this price bracket and won't fall apart.EDIT-2023Noise cancelling is way better now and I think it is just wear-in giving them a better fit. If I ever-so-slightly compress the ear cups against my head, the noise cancelling becomes absolutely amazing and it will stay that way when I let go. I think the spacing from the driver to my ear is was just too far when the cups were newer and stiffer. It was absolutely silent on my last flight and when I pulled them down to ask for coffee from the drink cart, I was startled by how suddenly loud it was. I would say they are every bit as good as the best of the best from Sony/Bose for noise cancelling, just needed to break in the cups.END_EDITThe phone app lets you setup a custom EQ and adjust preferences. You can connect to two devices at once, so Phone and Computer most likely. Battery life is crazy long, but if it ever does die, you can still use them corded.They use ACC, so they'll sound great with most phones, Mac, and Windows 10 when not using the mic, but Windows 11 tries to force them into SBC and Windows 10 will use SBC if you are using the mic and SBC sounds pretty bad. This is a Windows problem, not a JBL problem, but if JBL added support for another codec Windows likes better, it would be nice. If you're just doing Teams or something, SBC won't bother you, but you'll notice if trying to play music on Windows 11 and can't figure out how to force Windows back into ACC. If you don't know what ACC and SBC are, don't worry about it.Sound quality is definitely best when using them with noise cancelling on, but audio and noise cancelling are separate, so you can use one without the other if you want (weirdly not possible on some other headset brands).","Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2022",AFQ7ONQ33RAVGETG45SYUB4PO2ZA,True,151,Color: Black

I read on some reviews that eventually this goes away with break in, which brings me to my next con, the pad doesn't cover the ear, it goes on top of the ears and if you're eating or moving around it breaks the seal and you get all the outside noise while on ANC, which again, it should go away after break in.Again to do with the pads, this should have a carrying case to protect the pads. I'm not fond of the carrying bag that it comes with.I have purchased several other brands with better sound quality for around $30 to $80 dollars.Sound peats is at the top of my list, quality and price are unmatched.Then Earfun, I love their products, I have personally purchased several UBoom speakers as gifts and a few Ear Pro ear buds.Last but not least SoundCore Liberty Pro, I love the ANC feature. I wear these for travel but my ears get tired, so I only wear them for short periods of time, hence the purchase of these JBL headphones.It's a little unfair to compare ear buds to over the ear headphones because the ear buds plug up your ear canal giving you a better seal, so take this with a grain of salt and judge for yourself.","Reviewed in the United States August 14, 2023",AF76R2ZLYMJ3KZENKEQU7AQNMWJQ,True,8,Color: Black

I am 4’11 and prefer my headphones to be small since most just fall right off. These did fit my head, however if you include a mechanism that allows you to turn the ear pieces inward for storage and wear, then I would Expect them not to break.

It was simply wearing while vacuuming, doing the dishes, picking up toys etc. when they got taken off they were placed on my desk away from my kids so they wouldn’t get broken from rough use.HOWEVER, I was Able to get a replace from Harman Audio since it was within one year of the purchase date. The process was easy and I am Thankful of that. But the ease of connectivity, the use of the JBL app, and the noice canceling, pausing features, SIRI we’re all a big plus in my book.

I got them on amazon prime day for about $90 give or take. For that price these are good. For their retail or usual discounted price? Not a great value. First and foremost, comfort is terrible. These advertise as ""over-ear"" and maybe they are if you're an oompa loompa. I assure you these earcups are really small and that these will be ON EAR more than Over-ear. And to make it worse, they are a tight fit so it's constant pressure on the edges of your ears. Bluetooth headphones should put comfort first and foremost as they are predominately used on the go. Now, irritatingly terrible comfort aside, the sound is fine. It's not amazing, but for a bluetooth headphone they're okay. They have a good bit of Low Sub Rumble which is nice if you're into that but mid/high bass is lacking. As well as the very high end is pretty much nonexistent with these. I'd say these are a pretty dark headphone but not necessarily a warm pair. I quite like the sound signature even though they aren't particularly good. Features are nice, ANC is okay (not on the level of airpods/bose/sony yet but not awful. battery life is nice, Build quality is passable. If the earcups where just a tad bigger and they actually fit than I might say these are worth buying but as they stand I can't recommend them (unless you have unnaturally small ears or are a sicko who likes heavy pressure against your ears).

My issue lies within the sound quality of the headphones, for whatever reason they don't get very loud, and when your in a pretty loud environment such as the gym you can basically hear everything going on around you even with ANC on. Aside from this if you listen to a lot of Rock/Metal music these headphones aren't too bad, but when it comes to more bass heavy music, the sound tends to get pretty distorted when the bass hits. Overall these headphones aren't too bad if you can pick them up on sale, (I got them when they were on sale for $100) and for 100 dollars there's not much to complain about, but at they're regular $199.99 price tag, I'd say they aren't really worth it.","Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2024",AFNNYZUG2QEKHQHNY7TDC72UJ3SQ,True,0,Color: Black

For whatever reason, earbuds just don't hold their position during my runs, so getting quality headphones was a priority. Not only do these sound great, but the enclosed nature of these phones keep out ambient wind noise, and the audio sounds that much better. The manual controls are fine when you are sitting down, but not good at all for running. However, the built in voice command feature either with Google Go (for android) or Alexa, should overcome this. (note: I use neither) The only question now is durability, which I simply can't really rate until after several weeks of use.","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2023",AFMJUDEZNQ24LRGJGG5UILV3TQDQ,True,3,Color: Blue

I just, sadly, open my phone and control it that way. This is actually quite annoying.3. The touch features on the side don't seem useful. Instead of making it play\pause, it is to activate the assistant on your phone. Why not have one side play\pause and the other assistant or something? It's useless for me. Which feature do they think people use more?4. This is probably a personal complaint based upon my ear size and shape. The cuffs are soft, but they do begin to dig into my ears after a while.

RVQGQ3BMVNPPU,B09GJVTRNZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Small yet powerful little speakers that sound great!!!,The pc builder,5,So let start off by I’m old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands… I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin’s- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I’d like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don’t overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I’m sure you’ll love too!!!! Update with about a week of playing some music and experimenting. The flip 6 turn on its end with tweeters up will produce the best sound and great sound stage. It does better in the vertical position cause the woofer and tweeter vertically aligned give better sound stage hence the vertical axis. Now pair it with a second and you’ll have killer stereo mode.

R17KWZY74P83HQ,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Very Solid For Out-of-Office,Jason Brannock,4,"I left a lengthy review of the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. Since that review is out there, I'll reduce this one only to E285 and SX4.Microphone and PlaybackThe E285 was notably better than the SX4, as evidenced by my recordings while drumming. It’s neck and neck as far as clarity of voice goes.Akin to the E285, the SX4 are quite good as far as pick-up goes. But unfortunately, they were a little too good (or simply worse at distinguishing background noise). A co-worker and I had a Zoom meeting with ourselves in the same closet (to maximize productivity), switching between the headsets. Whoever had the E285 could hear themselves through the headset. At first, I thought it was because of the function where you hear yourself through the headset. But alas, upon one of us leaving the room, the echo went away. This meant the SX4 was picking up the other’s voice! The main killer of the SX4 is that you have no way to mute yourself from the headset. As a pair of headphones to be used in the office, this is crucial. You never know when someone may decide to butt in your closet (or office, for most people) and shout “HHHHEEEYYYY!!”. In contrast, the E285 offers two ways to protect yourself from such intrusions – by raising the boom arm or by pressing the button on the boom arm, leaving you to look down simply in resignation at said co-worker without having disrupted the meeting. The one drawback with the E285 is that sometimes the first word or two don’t quite make it through, so you may develop a stutter of your introduction. “I’m Jason – oh – I’M JASON – oh you can hear me now? I’m Jason”. Good news is, you shan’t be soon forgotten. Despite this, it’s more favorable than not being able to mute myself, though I can understand disagreement with this point. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophileBoth associated apps come with decent equalizers (unlike Bose). Honestly, it was difficult to tell the difference between the E285 and SX4. I think the amount of bass you get is comparable, however I think the SX4 is capable of producing an ever-so-slightly louder sound. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.BrandJabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice!Sony: same as Jabra, though with a caveat. The SX4 offers more utility when given Location permission, which will be addressed later on. They were not pertinent to me, however, so my location remains an enigma for Sony and Jabra (and Bose). Tie between E285 and SX4.ANCWhen playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. The E285 does a better job with impact noises (or maybe it’s just higher frequencies) than the other headsets, though the SX4 is perfectly satisfactory.In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. It almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). The SX4 has essentially the same feature, with an added “Focus on voice” option. I couldn’t tell a difference when that was on/off. Besides that, the SX4 didn’t do as good a job at allowing sound through as the E285. Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.ConnectivityThe E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. Unfortunately, I don't remember specifics about the SX4. SX4 and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. The QC35II and SX4 are only Bluetooth, so you have to do the standard “add device”, etc. One annoying thing about the SX4 is you have to use the app to establish a Bluetooth connection to another device. Not a big deal, but for comparison’s sake, the E285 is better. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.Response time: The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Again, the E285 feel lack-luster in comparison because they take approximately 4 M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-I seconds to pause, whereas the SX4 is half that time. For the E285, I’ve noticed the ear detection only works properly when playing music from your phone and not the PC. When using it with the PC, if I remove the headphones, the music will pause as it should. But it doesn’t resume when I put them back on. If I pause the music with the button, then remove the headset, it resumes. Again, cool feature, but needs work, especially when using it with the PC. So SX4 is better about ear detection (presumably because it's laser-assisted).App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Winner is SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.Voice AssistantThe E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature (you can still press the action button with the boom arm up and have the assistant prompt, but because the arm is up, the microphone is off so it’s pointless). Tie between E285 and SX4.ControlsOn the E285, the buttons take up little surface area and are rather flat. Muting is done with the E285 by simply raising or lowering the boom mic. In contrast, the SX4 doesn't have any way to mute yourself.After just a little use of the “touchless” controls (B700 and SX4), I can see their usefulness. It’s certainly easier to play/pause music and use the Voice Assistant (which is no easier to actually setup because Bose sucks). Changing volume is annoying because every click up/down requires an extra swipe. As debilitating as this is, one would not likely be changing by a bunch of increments at a time. After more use of the touchless controls, I much prefer the them over the physical ones. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.Comfort and StyleComfort is pretty much a tie between E285 and SX4. I've worn both for hours and hours without any issue. But I prefer the style of the SX4 - it just feels more premium. Winner is SX4. Runner up is E285.ExtraThe E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.IssuesThere’s some variability with functionality of the Google Assistant with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars, same as the SX4. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. I can't say the same for the SX4 since it was ultimately returned. I ended up choosing the E285 over the SX4 because it has an edge when it comes to office use, for one main reason - you can't mute yourself on the SX4. But if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.","Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2021",AGM4GFRMZNI3U2WHNRS734VKMZRA,True,67,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R709TK5SYB7PC,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Mostly great,Whirlaway,4,"UPDATE #2: After returning the first set of these headphones, I ordered another set on Prime Day and have now had a little more than a month to try them out. Based on this experience so far, I'm raising the rating from 2 to 4 stars. Trying not to jinx things, but the new unit does not have the right earcup static issue that plagued the first set (and that a not insignificant number of users have complained about). I'm not sure whether one of the firmware updates addressed the issue or whether the first set had a hardware issue of some sort, but the new set has not had the issue.I now believe the ""bluetooth stopping for no reason"" issue noted in my prior update is not a defect, but the speak to chat feature, which stops the playback whenever it detects a human voice. I understand the point of this feature, but Sony should calibrate it better. As it is, even when set on low sensitivity and not to focus on voice, it still stops playback at even low human voice volumes. As a practical matter, this means you can't sing or hum along to songs without having the playback constantly cut off. I've wound up disabling this feature.Other than that, the new headphones have been great -- super noise cancelling and music quality, decent phone call quality (maybe not best in class but more than serviceable), and day-in, day-out comfortable. The only reason I didn't rate them at 5 stars is that this set, like the previous one, has a very high default volume, such that sometimes when you turn the headphones on, the music will start blasting out at an uncomfortably high volume. (I think that if you use another set of headphones, as I sometimes do, the XM4 will forget its last volume setting.)UPDATED: I decided to mark these down from 3 to 2 stars because, in the last few days, the bluetooth has started to act buggy. Audio files simply stop playing for no apparent reason (in some cases, my music has stopped apparently because someone else with a bluetooth device gets within about 30 feet of me, but in other cases the music stops for no apparent reason at all). At other times, there are skips or pops. While the noise cancellation is fantastic, and I'm still thinking keeping them for this reason alone, I'm now more likely to return them -- $350 is just too much money for these kinds of problems.These are great headphones -- outstanding in many respects -- but they have some issues that, given the $350 price, do not merit a 5-star review. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars, but decided on the lower rating given the very high price for this product.PROS:1) ANC -- by far, these have the most effective noise cancellation of any ANC (or other) headphones I have used, including Bose. They drown out almost all ambient noise -- including close lawn mowers, leaf blowers, revving car engines, etc. -- even when you're not playing music or listening to another kind of audio file. When playing music or an audio file, you are very much in your own world. I did have an issue at the beginning where I could hear a static-like sound when ANC was on but no audio was playing. A software or firmware update pretty much, but not entirely, eliminated the issue; it's still noticeable from time to time, but at a very low volume, lower than the older set of wired Bose ANC headphones I still have. It's no longer an issue for me; I think that this kind of noise is a ""feature"" of ANC headphones.2) Comfort -- by far, these are the most comfortable set of headphones I have used. The ear pieces in particular are outstanding. I bought another brand of (much less expensive) headphones right before I got these and wrote a review in which I said those were very comfortable. However, I wound up returning those because, after about a week, they became quite uncomfortable. These Sony headphones, however, have withstood the test of time, seeming to become more comfortable as time goes on. I can comfortably wear these for hours.3) Music quality -- excellent, what you would expect of Sony.4) Gesture controls -- the gesture controls for turning music on / off, picking up a phone call, volume and next / previous song work quite well. I had a set of Sony 900 headphones prior to these, and the gesture controls work a little better on these.CONS:1) Default volume -- for some reason, these headphones, like my prior Sony 900 headphones, seem to have a high default volume and there is no way in the Sony Headphones or Sony Music Center to change them (and there is also no native iPhone setting that works, either). The result is that, all too often, music comes blasting out at an uncomfortable, probably unhealthy volume when you put the headphones on and start playing music. Beside the Sony 900, none of the other (many) headphones I have used have had this issue. I have now become accustomed to checking the iPhone's bluetooth volume when I put the headphones on, but all too frequently when the iPhone shows a low bluetooth volume, the volume resets itself to a much higher (almost max) volume when I actually start playing an audio file. I believe the problem must be related to the fact that all the settings for these headphones are run through the Headphones app and there is no control for default volume in that app; apparently, Sony sets a near-max default volume and doesn't allow users to change it. It's really quite annoying, and I may wind up returning these headphones for this reason. For $350, Sony could do a lot better on this metric.2) Phone call quality -- meh. Some calls are good, others not so much. Nobody on the other end has complained about call quality. However, on my end, the other person often sounds distant, low volume, in a tunnel, etc. Every other set of wireless headphones I have used with phone call capability has been at least as good as these headphones, and some have been better. I read that the MX4 is supposed to have corrected the problems of the MX3 regarding phone call quality issues but, if that's the case, I can only imagine how bad the MX3s were.3) Making you register with Sony in order to get updates -- as noted above, I needed to do a software or firmware update to get rid of the static noise when ANC is turned on. However, to get software updates, Sony requires you to register with it (provide email, etc.). It is obnoxious of Sony to require users to provide this kind of personal information that it will then market and sell, and presumably also spam you with promotions, as a precondition to getting updates to fix the bugs in its (expensive) products -- particularly where Sony has a history of data breach.Bottom line, these are mostly excellent headphones, and they are exceptional with regard to the primary purposes of noise cancelling headphones. However, they do have some problems that a $350 set of headphones should not have. I'm likely to keep them, but if the default volume issue noted above does not improve, I may well return them.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2020",AGY3FKXCB7VCVYWXHL4MLDKIBUUQ,True,37,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R2USDO6PGSXOSG,B0863TXGM3,"2.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, good NC...multipoint Bluetooth FAIL!",John,2,"I've owned the Sony 1000XM3, H900N, and the Bose QC35 II. I couldn't wait for the XM4 to come out because of the multipoint Bluetooth (I'll get to that a little later). The sound is great once it's been adjusted, and the noise cancelling in the XM4 is better than both the XM3 and the QC35 II. However, there are quite a few things that are very poorly implemented and basically unusable.Sound: A-First off the XM4, XM3, and H900N all have better and brighter sound than the QC35 II. Out of the box, the sound is a little dull and the mids / vocals are a little mushy. With the XM4, I needed to tweak it in the Headphones app using the EQ to get it to the place that I wanted it, but once it was there, it was great. A small but pleasing improvement in the XM4 is that the headphone voice announcements are at a much higher quality. The XM3 announcements are low fidelity and low bandwidth whereas the XM4 headphone voice is very crisp and hi-fi. Sony also replaced the high-pitched beep with a slightly longer but more pleasant sounding bell for feedback. However, I actually prefer the beep because it's faster.Noise cancelling: A-When I first put on the XM4 and turned them on, I was surprised by the audible hiss from the noise cancelling. It wasn't present with the XM3. I think this is because they have cranked up the noise cancelling in the XM4. I have air purifiers running in my house, and the XM4 does a better job of cancelling out the noise almost completely. The XM3 still has some leakage. The XM3 is just as good as the Bose in noise cancellation, and the XM4, though a little hissy and is a slightly bit better. The drawback to this is that it can feel like it's creating a slight pressure in my head that increases over time.Multipoint Bluetooth: FThis was the feature I had been waiting for. The awesome noise cancellation and sound of the XM3, but with the ability to stream two devices at once. FAIL! I had been eagerly anticipating this and checking daily for the release of the XM4. I was so excited to get them...only to be sorely disappointed. Though the device will connect to two devices simultaneously, it actually DISCONNECTS when one of the two devices is activated. So it's not true multipoint Bluetooth. Sony advertises that the multipoint Bluetooth is seamless. This is true if they mean you don't have to press any buttons to disconnect from a device. However, the way it manages connections is very poor. I have to put the XM4 into pairing mode if I've connected to my phone in order for it to play audio from my computer. If I don't do this, it doesn't recognize that my computer is playing sound, and then doesn't stream the sound. Even though it shows on my computer as connected, it doesn't show up in my sound options as a device that I can use for audio. I have to turn them off, put them into pairing mode, and then reconnect in order to get the sound to play. If a call comes in on my phone, the headphones actually disconnect from the computer to switch to the call - and the headphone voice announces that they have disconnected, super annoying and not seamless. With the QC35 II, I could use both at the same time, with the phone being connected at the low-quality voice mode and my computer at the high quality music mode. They had 2 years to get the multipoint Bluetooth right and they totally failed. So it ends up that I have to turn the XM4 off and re-pair them just like I had to with the XM3. I've had to do this a number of times, and I haven't quite figured out all the exact situations where I have to re-pair them. With the XM3, I knew if I wanted to switch devices, I would have to do it. But with the XM4, I haven't put my finger on all of them just yet. At any rate, the switching of devices is very clunky and definitely not worth upgrading for. I have $40 headphones that implement multipoint Bluetooth better than the XM4. I'm stunned and disappointed that Sony hasn't been able to get multipoint Bluetooth to work right.Comfort: ACompared to the XM3, the XM4 are slightly softer and a bit more comfortable right when I put them on. The XM3 are still pretty comfortable, but the earpads are definitely firmer and a little tighter.Controls: BI totally prefer the actual buttons on the QC35 II to the touch controls. Sometimes if I want to change the volume and I slide my finger at a slightly off-angle, it will skip tracks instead. It's a small annoyance. On the plus side, the physical buttons do make a fairly audible click that travels through the headphone, whereas the touch controls are a little quieter.In-call: DOne thing the Bose QC35 II does is that when I'm on a call, it knows to automatically turn on ambient sound mode so I can hear myself talking. Neither the XM3 nor the XM4 figured out that this is a useful and great feature, so they don't do it. If I want it, I have to press the button to switch to it, listen to the announcement, and then it comes on. Then when I'm done, I have to press the button and wait for it to go into NC off, ambient sound off, and then press the button again and wait for the announcement that the NC is once again activated. Super slow and awkward and unusable. So instead, I pull one of the earcups off my ear so I can hear myself speak. When I first was using the Sony's for calls, I was finding that my voice was tired and my throat sore at the end of the day. Someone told me that I talked really loud when I was on the phone. I didn't even know this because the headphones do a really great job of keeping outside sound out, so I was talking at a level so I could hear myself when I was wearing them. I asked Sony support about this, and the headphones just don't do this. Fail.Auto-mute: FSony created a feature where the headphones will automatically mute the audio source if it detects that you're talking. Nice in concept - terrible in practice. I just turned it off and left it off. If I'm listening to music and sneeze or make a noise, the headphones will interrupt what I'm listening to and mute it for the amount of time I've specified in the app - 15 seconds is the shortest amount of time. So I have to wait for it to unmute so that I can continue listening. What's even more annoying is when I'm using the auxiliary cable in wired mode - again, this is because the multipoint Bluetooth implementation is such a pain and sucks, if I'm on a video conference and I have the headphones on to use the noise cancelling, if I talk, it mutes the audio stream for 15 seconds so I can't hear what anyone in the conference is saying. So I then have to turn the headphones off in order to interact with the conference in any meaningful way.Miscellaneous:I don't understand why Sony doesn't just include a headphone cable with a microphone. With all the video-conferencing I do, and the terrible multipoint Bluetooth implementation, I end up using the auxiliary headphone cable a lot. It's much faster and convenient for me to switch the plug from my computer to my phone rather than dealing with the horrible Bluetooth switching. The auxiliary cable Sony provides doesn't have a microphone, so I have to hold my phone close to my mouth if I'm using the cable. I ended up buying an auxiliary cable with a microphone and some playback controls on it and it works great. Here's another really poorly thought-out thing: upon pairing the new XM4 with the app, it gives me the opportunity to give feedback on the headphones. This is only upon the initial startup of the headphones. How on earth can I give meaningful feedback about the headphones on my first use? It took me to Sony's site to do the survey, and I decided I would complete it later, only to discover that it had timed out, and now I'm not able to provide feedback through that mechanism.Conclusion:All the hype about multipoint Bluetooth is a big letdown with the real product. If that's the reason you're thinking about upgrading, don't do it. The rest of it is pretty similar to the XM3. Some nice little features added, but nothing earth shattering. The new features on paper were everything that I wanted that was missing from the XM3. In practice, the XM4 implementation of these things just did not hit the mark. I soooo wanted to love these headphones, so that I could stop looking for headphones. As it stands, they totally weren't worth the upgrade and I will most likely be sending these back. Sadly, they are not as advertised.","Reviewed in the United States September 19, 2020",AFDEU4TPM7P7QRC7HKAXHD4O5L3Q,True,43,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
RJE80FBWZNCH6,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Mind blowing noise cancellation,Hugo Stiglitz,5,"The noise cancellation is insane. The first time i turned them on i couldnt believe it. I was used to pretty weak NC, and these are supposed to be the best. What a differenceOne thing i hadnt thought of is that noise cancellation actually does make a big difference to sound quality while previously i didnt think it was that important. But because it gives you an almost silent environment, everything sounds better.I also love that it has LDAC support. The transmission rate is automatic and unfortunately rarely uses the highest quality, but you can force it with developer options on any android phone (look up a guide to do that). The connection is perfect on the lower settings and you can go 100ft away from your phone and itll still work fine. Its only at the highest setting that theres any issues, but IMO its still worth using if you have high res audio files. Its near indistinguishable from the sound quality of a wired connection at the point (and assuming youre not in a totally silent envionment with NC off.TThe only weak point is the frequency response, but its also personal preference. Its balanced but bass heavy which a lot of people like. I don't. In my opinion it should be more neutral.When audio professionals mix and master music, they already put in as much bass as they can (in modern music) so there's no need for headphones to add even more. They know what theyre doing so it makes no sense to me to try and ""enhance"" what doesnt need to be ""enhanced""Unfortunately most consumers think more bass = better so headphone makers aren't afraid to add more than is necessary especially when other manufacturers add a ton, meaning if you don't as well people might say your product has weak bass, which isn't the case at all","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AF2WNSSZUVLPCMWGE7LNOXZTLGPQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

R28ULTR4EVN00O,B0863TXGM3,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good, but be aware of quirks and limitations",tapu,4,"UPDATE 11/11/20: With the release of firmware 2.0.7 these have become usable for conference calls on Windows 10. The issue with initial syllables getting cut-off appears to be fixed and overall I have reports when using Skype and Zoom from my co-workers is that I now sound as good as (or maybe even a bit better than) other co-workers using Bose NC 700 headphones. According to Sony's release notes this firmware update is only supposed to address connection stability on Windows. I have increased my rating to 4 stars.UPDATE 10/30/20: No update from Sony on the microphone issue. My co-worker have asked that I use a different microphone as the microphone audio is quite poor. I'm outside the Amazon return window, but am currently working with Sony to hopefully get these at least exchanged if not returned.UPDATE: After a week, I am getting many complaints from people on the other end of my conference calls. Zoom / WebEx / etc. This is a serious issue that impacts me on a daily basis. I have put a case into Sony support and hoping they release a new firmware soon to fix the call quality.Below is my ""evergreen"" review which I will update whenever I have revised my opinion of these phones due to either new experiences or updated firmware, etc.Compared to my 2 year old Sony WH-H900N:Pros:+ More equalization options, including the ability to use the EQ with LDAC codec.+ Stronger ANC, particularly high-pitched whines and voices are significantly more attenuated by the XM4. Airplane or fan noise is not hugely different. Overall the ANC on the XM4 is superior.+ True multipoint connectivity allows you to connect the XM4 to two different devices simultaneously. Both AD2P and HSP profiles can be simultaneously connected to 2 different devices. The H900N can independently connect their AD2P and HSP profiles to two different devices which can allow music to be played on a PC while using a phone for voice calls, but it is tricky to connect/disconnect the correct profiles each time you power cycle the headphones. The XM4 are much improved on this front, although the priority switching is a bit dodgy in my opinion and takes a few seconds to detect and switch devices, so it's easy to miss notifications or other brief sounds when multiply connected.+ The XM4 are better for making calls in noisy environments, although the overall quality is mediocre at best. Any halfway decent gaming headset or office headset will do a better job of capturing just your voice. I tested versus my Sennheiser G4ME One wired headset.+ (slightly) more compact travel case since the earcups both swivel and fold whereas the H900N only fold+ XM4 allows you to mix in a variable amount of ambient sound whereas the H900N has only 1 setting for ambient sound+ The WH-1000XM4 while improved, are still poor in windy situations, even when put into ""wind"" mode, which does help. I haven't had a chance to compare the XM4 on a voice call in windy environments. The H900N are unusable in wind for phone calls, I have to switch to the handset.Cons:- The WH-1000XM4 have significantly less Bluetooth 4.0 range, I get crackling and break-up within 3 meters where the WH-H900N easily reach 10 meters. This is a big deal when working from home. With the H900N I could make a phone call from the kitchen with my computer in the office and be pretty confident that I could still speak and hear everything. With the XM4 I can't leave my office without huge glitching. EDIT: I swapped out my BT4.0 adapter to a BT5.0 adapter on my desktop and with this, I can get ~20 meter range with my XM4, still not quite as good as the H900N gets with BT4, but acceptable for my uses.- Overall, WH-1000XM4 do not sound much better, in fact at default factory settings, the midrange is a bit muffled and bass response bloated versus older headphones, tweaking Clear Bass setting to -2 helps- The WH-1000XM4 ANC presents a low-level background hiss and a sucking sensation on the ears- The WH-1000XM4 do not support Qualcomm aptx codecs- The WH-1000XM4 have worse microphone quality when used in quiet environments.- Hold-hand-to-right-earcup-to-speak actually works better on the older headphones as Sony apparently wants you to use the deeply problematic speak-to-chat automatic feature insteadEqual:* Battery life is roughly the same, with ~24 hours for the older headphones versus ~30 hours for the newer* Bluetooth pairing is similarly slow on both headphones* Both support LDAC codec for high bitrate sound (although when in 2-device mode LDAC cannot be used)* Overall weight and comfort is similar, with the XM4 being a bit lighter* Ear heat is a problem with both headphones, slightly cooler on the XM4* Neither headphone can use the microphone when listening via wired connection, come on Sony!* Neither headphone can be used as a USB headset (even though the phones are recognized by Windows 10, they do not show up as an audio device)* Touch controls are essentially identical, in fact the H900N are actually a bit more responsive although perhaps I'll get used to the XM4Personal Preference:* The style of the older headphones is a bit nicer in my opinion, and they are available in more colors* The newer XM4 use USB-C charging versus micro-usb for the older headphones. This should be a pro for the XM4 but the XM4 won't charge on any of my USB-C PD chargers, so I have to either plug them into a port on my computer or find an old low-power phone charger to charge them. The H900N are less finicky about what charger they will accept.* The ""silver"" XM4 is really a grayish-beige which is pretty ugly, I wish I'd have bought boring basic black.Overall I am disappointed that these are not a bigger upgrade over my 3 year old headphones. I knew from various reviews that the H900N sounded better than the 1000XM, and 1000XM2, with reviews being a bit equivocal on the XM3. I was expecting the XM4 to blow the H900N away, but really they are barely better except for multipoint and ANC.","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2020",AGNOHQRHY74UUQ6YUYPHD5MWD6JA,True,17,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
R1KYYRPR3VE2DG,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Get these...at the right price,H. Ricks,4,"I got these as a 2023 Christmas upgrade from the XB-900. I loved their sound quality (especially the bass of the XB-900), but it lacked conveniences that made it difficult to use those on a regular basis (being that I'm in the Apple ecosystem (iPhone/iPad/Mac and Apple TV). When they were around 30% off, it was a no-brainer.The ANC is still great. They may not be on the level of AirPods Max, but they're just as good as the XM-500's. The sound quality is more 'balanced,' so while you don't get massive bass (like the XB series, Skullcrusher or Sony Ult), they can keep up.But my favorite aspects, coming from the XB900's, are its ability to multi-pair between 2 devices. It was frustrating to have to go through a process just to switch devices. Granted, you have to use the app to enable them between devices, but that's still better than having to go into bluetooth settings and unpair, then re-pair.Also, I like the play/pause gesture feature that weren't on the XB900. While it wasn't that much of a biggie (be it tap the cup to pause or pause on the app or device), it felt more natural to just take them off for it to pause your media. And, unlike some of Apple's offerings, I like that you can create your own EQ settings than their stock settings.While it took some time to modify the settings for ANC/pass-through (based on work/home/travel environments), the experience when using is great.Overall...the XM-400's are as good as the newer 'flagship' XM500 (almost forgot: they fold better...be around your neck or case). You're getting great sound, great ANC, great battery life, decent build (albeit plastic) and great customization. But if you get these when on sale (especially around or under $230), you're getting a premium device at a 'Goldilocks' price!My 3 cents...","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AH34Y7RKTMJ47UGXWZPX25J3JMZQ,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

Battery life is respectable, lasting a full day easily, and charge very quickly in about an hour.Only 'issue' is that they press on my ears pretty good, so I can't use them for more than, say, 3 hours before they become a bit uncomfortable and I need to give my ears a break. The other is I live in hot Puerto Rico and I can sweat a bit because of these. Wouldn't recommend them for working out, like I see others use at the gym; use any type of buds for working out instead. But these issues are inherent to over-ear headphones, so I can't take points away.

R2PLH336KUYCO9,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Sounding but Relatively Dumb,Jason H,4,"These headphones sound great. I have been testing them against AirPods Max with my iPhone.Used, they are an exceptional value for this quality of sound. However after wearing them many hours I have decided to go with the AirPods Max as my primary pair, because they are extremely intuitive and the transparency mode is great for my house with noisy young children I still need to communicate with.The XM4’s attempts at being smart kust annoy me, like automatically turning off when I sneeze or sniff with a cold. The transparency mode amplifies annoying sounds like silverware falling in the sink. You can disable all of that, and are left with a great sounding headphone for the price.If it is within your budget the AirPods max will serve you far better if you, like me, like to wear headphones at all times. The only potential drawback of the APM other than the price is the weight, but I found them fine.I may keep these for travel, as they are light, the noise cancellation is excellent, and I wouldn’t be devastated if they were lost or stolen.Around the house I will use the Apple headphones. The usability of these two is not even close if you use an Iphone. The Apple APM are so inituitive you only have to remember to charge them.

I did a lot of research and it was clear that there was no one model that was best at everything. So, I prioritized what I was looking for (in rough order):1) physical comfort (nothing else really matters if they're painful to wear)2) blocking out outside noise (household noise, cars passing by, leaf blowers, etc.)3) technical ease (i.e., easily connecting to both my phone and laptop)4) microphone quality (for phone calls and Zoom)5) sound quality for music (I tested with EDM and IDM music)6) cost (I was willing to pay more for quality as long as it wasn't outrageous)7) battery life (not really important to me as long as it gets through the workday)After a lot of reading, I narrowed it down to five:Bose 700Sony WH-1000XM4Jabra Evolve2 65Jabra 85HJabra Evolve 75And I ultimately ordered the top 3.Here's my review:Sony WH-1000XM4:- This was the clear winner for me: most comfortable, best at blocking out outside noise, excellent music quality, and easy to use- I appreciate how it automatically adjusts the noise canceling settings based on activity (sitting still, walking, etc.), and I had no trouble connecting it to my phone and computer at the same time- The biggest downside (other than the high price) is that it was definitely the worst microphone of the three. People on the other end were able to understand me, but when I listened to recordings it definitely sounded more muffled and less clear than with the other two headphonesthough its microphone quality isn't great- It's probably also worth mentioning that my brother tried these on and he found them uncomfortable because he has large ears, whereas the Bose 700 felt fine for himBose 700:- This was a close runner-up: good at blocking outside noise, comfortable enough (but I felt it squeezing my head more than the Sony), and good music quality (I even preferred it to the Sony for some songs, though in general I felt like the instruments were somehow a bit further away or flat compared to the Sony)- It gave me just a little trouble to connect to phone and computer at once but it was fine once I got it set up the first time- The microphone was noticeably better than the Sony's but still not greatJabra Evolve2 65:- Surprisingly good music quality given its purpose as more of an office headset; but, given its protruding microphone arm, I was expecting significantly better mic quality than the other two when in fact I only found it to be a little better than the Bose- Fairly comfortable, but I preferred the way that the other two completely enclosed my ears rather than just squeezing against them as the Jabra did- Setup was easy and I appreciated the USB dongle to wirelessly connect it without fiddling with BluetoothSOME TAKEAWAYS:- Ultimately, I learned that all of these have pretty bad microphones, so you'll need to get a dedicated microphone if you really care about recording sound quality- This is of course personal preference, but I still find my Jabra Elite Sport earbuds from 2018 to be more comfortable than all of these, and they surprisingly had just as good or better microphone quality than all of these fancier larger headphones. I'm able to wear the Sony or the Bose headphones for a few hours, but my ears still feel a bit tender when I take them off- I was quite surprised that the active noise canceling was fine for me on both the Bose and the Sony. I had tried a previous Bose model years ago and experienced a lot of painful pressure on my ears, so I was quite happy to discover that I rarely experienced that here. I'm not sure if the tech has just gotten better or if I've acclimated somehow, but consider giving the Bose or Sony a try even if you've had trouble with this in the pastDECISION:I ended up choosing the Sony WH-1000XM4, which are in most ways the best headphones I've ever used (with important caveats below). When I started my search, my top priority was how well they worked for Zoom calls. Music quality was a secondary concern. But after spending weeks with these headphones, I'm pretty blown away by how my music sounds, like new dimensions have been opened up. I recommend them, along with the Wavelet smartphone app for AutoEq equalization tuned to these headphones specifically. However, there are two glaring flaws you should know about:1) The microphone quality really isn't great. When I'm in Zoom meetings, I set it to use my laptop's built-in microphone instead since it sounds better.2) It does pair well with my laptop and smartphone at once. But, there are some quirks that are extremely annoying. Whenever one of the two disconnects, a voice loudly announces, ""Bluetooth device disconnected."" So, say I'm listening to music on my phone or on a phone call—if my laptop falls asleep or I turn it off, my music or call will be interrupted with that useless announcement. Even worse, whenever you answer a phone call, it disconnects momentarily from the computer, so as soon as your phone call begins it makes that loud announcement and you miss the first few seconds of your call.Yes, you heard that right: If your laptop is on and the headphones are connected to it and your smartphone (which is supposed to be one of the best features), then every time you answer the phone the first few seconds of the call will be interrupted.So that's why it loses one star. But truly, the music quality and noise-canceling are so great that I really like them anyway and am willing to work around this limitation. I sure wish Sony would release a firmware update though allowing us to disable that voice completely!","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2021",AHYELS2PGI2XCI3HB3O5UDG3JQUQ,True,57,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

They have managed to take an already exceptional product and refine it, creating a headphone series that is truly unrivaled in its class.In conclusion, as someone who has witnessed the evolution of the Sony WH-1000XM headphones from their inception, I am thrilled to see how they have evolved into the remarkable WH-1000XM4. These headphones are a testament to Sony's relentless pursuit of perfection and their ability to create a product that transcends expectations. The WH-1000XM series is a shining example of how a product can improve over time, just like a fine wine that only gets better with age.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2023",AGHMHZPHN3GJVXRAIALIMV5ZVOWQ,True,82,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only
R3IQEWJQSCBF0J,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones for travel and everyday,Amazon Customer,5,"I bought these before two international trips this summer, the longer of which was to Europe. These are so comfortable for long periods of time and the sound is fantastic! They blocked out every noise on the plane for my 10.5 hour flight to Europe and back. The battery life is also great. I charged them fully before my travel day and used them for a total of 13 hours on Bluetooth. The charge was around 50% when we landed. It's also nice that it doesn't use battery when you plug them in. I don't know enough about headphones to know if that's a standard feature, but I found it a great way to save battery.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2024",AFLX3H4YL6GLS7TOPFK4UJGWD6NA,True,0,Color: SilverStyle: Headphones Only
R3EP21P1PITC3,B0863TXGM3,4.0 out of 5 stars Great but wait for sale,DJ,4,"These are awesome but for $350 there's a few pain points, you may be just as happy with headphones under $200. At full price I'd give them three stars and consider returning them.Sounds quality is great, I prefer them to my ear buds. Noise cancelling is good. I walked by someone mowing the lawn and couldn't barely hear it.The touch controls on don't always work except when I'm not trying to use them. You can turn them off in the app but there's no buttons for them. Noise cancelling was great until I ran the optimizer. Then it produced static and sounded like I was in a wind tunnel. It took some experimenting and help from reddit to get them back to default. Over time the ambient (pass through) mode develops a noise like wind or passing traffic making it difficult to listen to anything in that mode. They are comfortable but not for wearing more than a few hours. Im hoping the hinges don't suddenly snap like my 720 did (lasted a couple years). If you're lucky you can superglue or duct tape them back together, but it's a difficult place to tape back together.","Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2024",AEVVUWUFZJLAFIAE7X7MFLSDEK7Q,True,0,Color: BlueStyle: Headphones Only

Both the noise canceling and transparency on these is fantastic and they hold a charge for a long time. The sound is clear and crisp, and can be adjusted to your tastes in the app. I bought mine used and they still work great. The only downside would be is that they do leak sound a little bit, but it’s only really noticeable in a dead silent room or if someone is sitting right next to you.

R32NKDVGVF2QPR,B0863TXGM3,5.0 out of 5 stars Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works great!,JWH,5,"The Sony WH-1000XM4 Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) works great! Put on the headphones, turn on the power and it's like the aircraft engines have turned off - the low rumble is just gone. Entertainment doesn't have to be turned as loud in order to hear it clearly.The best thing about the Sony is that it can be used ""wired"" into airline entertainment, rather than having always to rely on finicky BlueTooth. The Sony comes with a two-prong adapter to fit the airlines two-prong plug holes, but the adapter isn't necessary (at least on United Airliness 787 aircraft). It appeared to me the two-prong aircraft sockets were made up of 3.5mm and a 2.5mm holes. (I didn't have a 2.5mm plug, so I can't swear to that.) The Sony jack was 3.5mm and it worked well plugging it into the other, 3.5mm, socket - complete stereo worked. From testing at home I'd say the wired configuration provides slightly better sound than through BlueTooth, also. Wired appears to provide better power usage, too; I used it on a 17-hour flight for three movies, I think, and arrived with the power level at 80% from starting at 90%.It does require a bit of a learning curve, so I wouldn't expect a newbie like me to pull it out of the box for the first time while on the aircraft and expect it to be satisfying. This is my first ANC device in maybe 10 years and that first experience wasn't successful, so it took me awhile to try again. Basically, hold the power button for two seconds to turn it on, hold it for seven seconds to pair with BlueTooth. You can get by without the Sony headphones app, but without it you won't know the battery charge level or be able to change sound profiles; I want to hear dialog better, so I have bass present, but not overwhelmingly so. Interestingly, you can pair the headphones with two devices at the same time, while other ANC earbuds just switch fast between two different connections. Both appear to work okay and allow you to listen to your cellphone music or the aircraft entertainment. Sony has short little movies that walked me through headphone settings.That's a lot of ""pro,"" but there are a few ""cons."" Over-ear headsets are bulky and have to be carried in already stuffed carry-on luggage. Some people don't like the pressure of over-ear headsets on their ears. That's about it, though, and if you've bought them at all then these issues don't sneak up on you. I've had them for a month or so now so I can't speak to their sturdiness or long-term reliability, but they do appear to be sturdy and the case protects them.What would I like to see improved? Not much, for over-ear ANC headsets. If I could find a set of wired ANC earbuds I'd surely try them to cut down on the bulk, but they'd have to work very well to provide the same sense of isolation I get from over-ear headsets. As things are, this Sony is definitely a ""buy.""","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2023",AEGS73DFBTN563YPSMA2EM2EEEAA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Headphones Only

R1XX4TUH1QR3UL,B07DD3VXRZ,"4.0 out of 5 stars Buena calidad de sonido, pero...",Jorge Sarmiento,4,"Llevo tres meses utilizando el BOOM 3 y me parece pertinente hablar de sus características. Empecemos por las cosas buenas:1. CALIDAD DE SONIDOEs necesario resaltar la calidad tan excelsa de sonido que tiene este parlante. Los entendidos sabemos que la conexión por Bluetooth acarrea pérdida considerable en la calidad del sonido. Sin embargo, he de decir que el BOOM 3 me sorprendió sobremanera: agudos y medios en su punto y los bajos, aunque poco notorios y exagerados, son cómodos y audibles.2. VOLUMEN Y POTENCIAEl BOOM 3 es ideal para aquellos que quieran utilizarlo en una habitación pequeña o en una reunión o fiesta. Esto es así porque puede llegar a ser discreto y a la vez muy potente sin llegar a afectar demasiado la calidad de sonido.3. WATERPROOFNo he testeado el parlante sumergiéndolo de lleno en agua, pero se ha llegado a mojar levemente y hasta el momento no ha presentado problemas.Llegó la hora de hablar de lo malo:1. CARGA Y BATERÍASi bien es cierto que la duración de la batería no es el fuerte de este aparato, uno esperaría más por algo que cuesta más de cien dólares. Hay aparatos muchísimo más económicos que tienen una carga más duradera independientemente del uso. Si usas el BOOM 3 discretamente, la batería puede durar más de 10 horas non-stop. Pero si usas el BOOM 3 con el volumen máximo, la carga solo te va a durar cuatro o cinco horas (a menos que lo uses mientras esté conectado a la energía). Se entiende que se hayan decantado por un uso más discreto y se hayan enfocado en un parlante que provea una calidad de sonido óptima, pero repito: este parlante cuesta más de cien dólares y me parece que la batería quedó a deber.2. BUGS Y FUNCIONALIDADES INÚTILESEl botón Magic está muy bien pero tiene muchos defectos. Por ejemplo, no reconoce si laa playlists que añadas están en aleatorio y las termina reproduciendo por default. El conectar dos parlantes con la app me parece genial pero dudo mucho que alguien lo vaya a usar del todo. Con la app de Ultimate Ears no siempre puedes conectarte al aparato y en esos casos debes encenderlo manualmente. Hubo una vez que el aparato no respondía a la conexión y, debido a que la caja no incluye un manual de instrucciones, tuve que buscar en internet para ver cómo lo reseteaba por defecto.Resumiendo:Buena calidad de sonido, buena potencia y buena resistencia al agua. Mala distribución de la carga y mal sistema de conexión.¿Vale la pena comprarlo? Depende de cómo lo quieras usar. Si pretendes usar un parlante para un uso más doméstico y disfrutar de la música en una calidad de sonido decente, este es tu producto. Pero si quieres algo más profesional o externo, puedes conseguir algo mejor.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2023",AE55TVZYQ4SFDSGABXMU7JPEDKFA,True,14,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

R10AD2QSAZA36K,B07DD3VXRZ,4.0 out of 5 stars Preferred this over Bose and JBL speakers,Tyler Cash,4,"I went to a Best Buy to look at portable bluetooth speakers. I was able to compare bluetooth speakers from Bose, JBL, and Ultimate Ears. Of all the speakers I listened to at this size and price point, this had the best sound. Best Buy didn't have any BOOM 3 speakers in stock, so I ordered from Amazon. Its been a definite upgrade from my previous similarly sized portable bluetooth speaker, with stronger bass hits and bigger sound overall. The bigger (and more expensive) speakers I listened to sounded better for sure, but the BOOM 3 does great for a more affordable speaker of its size.Its no audiophile speaker. It's tuned for popular music, with particular emphasis on bass and percussive hits. Which is fine, since that's what I was looking for and expecting from a speaker of this size and price. It does a decent job with today's top-40 style music. I don't listen to much rap or R&B, but I think it would do great with those genres as well. Music like Olivia Rodriguez's ""Good 4 U"" was pretty satisfying to listen to. Ultimate ears even provides an app where you can EQ the sound to something that you personally like even better.Music like ""Tightrope"" from the Greatest Showman soundtrack or ""Zanarkand"" from Final Fantasy Distant Worlds was a different story. They sounded muddy and lacked detail in a very unsatisfying way. I don't thing the EQ app can do anything to help that out. You'll want a different speaker if you're looking for a speaker for vocal, orchestral, jazz, etc.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2022",AFHDPQ3WBQQMUQNB46TWQCOSHXPQ,True,21,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

R200IE3MUNI9EU,B07DD3VXRZ,5.0 out of 5 stars good size + sound quality,Omar Siddique,5,"Nice clear mids & decent bass, in an attractive device, make this an all-around winner.On the negative side: there's a mostly unnecessary app, oversized volume buttons, and a I'd prefer it had a USB-C power connector instead of the old ""micro"" connector.Over all, this is a great speaker. It also looks really nice, and feels solid in-hand. The UE is small/light enough that I use it as my travel speaker, although I prefer the boom-ier bass on my (heavier) JBL for workout and party music at home.This speaker sounds good, but not obtrusive-- natural for various genres. The default tuning is ""fine"". Unusual for a Bluetooth speaker, there is an EQ feature on the app, but it doesn't let you turn one band up without decreasing the others. Good for tuning the sound quality for eg, spoken podcasts, but you can't turn up the bass or the treble like you might on a usual sound system.The app also allows using the speaker's top ""smart"" button to automatically launch playlists without otherwise interacting with a device. A clever idea, but since I usually use an AI (like Google Assistant) I find it unnnecessary, and better to not have too many random apps installed. The speaker works beautifully without the app-- totally optional.I used to buy Logitech PC speakers long ago, and they still make good ""gaming"" speakers. It's interesting Logi acquired Ultimate Ears, a brand I hadn't heard of before. A good move on their part, as this is one of the two best speakers I tested recently in my search for the perfect hardware.Highly Recommended.","Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2020",AGMITI35DNIHMTUWA6JSEYH43FGQ,True,9,Color: Sunset RedPattern: Speaker

R1KELUR90PO5A3,B07DD3VXRZ,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little speaker,Labcoated,5,"I've been putting this speaker through its paces for the last few hours and I'm really impressed. Sound quality, water resistance, and build quality is all there. The app is well designed, pairing is quick and easy, and bluetooth range covers my entire apartment.It's important to understand that you're not gonna get crazy sub bass on this thing, but that's not what they're trying to do here. One thing I really have to hand it to UE for on this speaker is instead of trying to reproduce frequencies in those bottom sub ranges, they have obviously set a hard shelf on the EQ that totally eliminates those frequencies from the mix rather than try to make the small speakers in this unit try for it anyway. A lot of other bluetooth speakers I've heard fail pretty hard at that and you end up with distortion and a lot of muddiness in the low range because of it. The tradeoff is that especially low end music (namely drum and bass, dubstep, 808 heavy hip hop and trap, etc) isn't going to exactly shine on this speaker.What does sound great, though, is just about everything else that doesn't rely on sub bass. Rock, jazz, metal, most hip hop, most electronic, funk, r&b, podcasts, etc all sound really clear and have great dynamics. This speaker is also capable of going extremely loud. I couldn't get it past around 70% volume in my apartment without it being excessive, yet the music sounded totally clear and free of distortion even when I cranked it.Also, I brought it in the shower to test and it got wet without issue and dried off quickly.I just got the speaker so time will tell how reliable it is, but count me as impressed. I'm looking forward to taking this on river floats next summer. Really happy that well made, waterproof electronics are readily available now. That was by far one of the biggest selling points to me after the sound quality.They should have used USB C, that's maybe my biggest gripe, I've never cared for micro USB.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2018",AGVINZPVX6XN7HFBN4XKCKCLOOCA,True,49,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

The sound was good and so was the Bluetooth range and the battery life is really good. It has notification sounds that play really loud but you can turn them off so that's not a big deal until you can't turn them off, or the speaker.6 months in the ""magic"" button got stuck. It was always a little touchy but it worked and I never paid it any mind but once it got stuck, none of the other buttons worked anymore. The volume and power buttons no longer responded because the magic button was constantly being pressed. There is an app and I could turn the power off that way but minutes later the power was back on because the magic button was depressed. It took days for the battery to run down and at certain intervals it would announce that some feature was not available and to check the aps internet connection, really loudly. When the battery finally ran down it started screaming that the battery was low every 30 seconds. i had to stash it out in the garage.I contacted support and they got back to me saying the warranty doesn't cover the stuck magic button because it was damaged, the kicker is I never said the speaker was damaged, only that the button was stuck.Since it was no longer covered I found a tutorial on how to take it apart and found that the screws that hold the switch in place were so tight that the switch didn't have room to release. I loosened the screws and the speaker is back to working like it should except it's no longer waterproof. That sounds like a manufacturing defect to me. I let Logitech support know what I found and we'll see what they have to say.I would have given the speaker 5 stars but the business with support knocks it down a couple notches in my opinion.","Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2020",AHRLZLHRJOA3UFOB2ZV5EEI2EO2A,True,2,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

I'm not a snob when it comes to portable speakers, great sound is achieved under controlled circumstances with much better equipment, this is good for what it is!The app is nice, but doesn't add a lot for me, I can get most of the functions it provides elsewhere, except for the battery level, nice to check before heading out for a day or weekend.The only small flaw I've found to date is the lack of being able to answer a phone call with it. I'm torn on how important of a feature that really is, but it feels like they could have added it and still kept their minimal, clean, very simple controls in tact.I'm very happy with this speaker and it's sort of become my go-to, it's beating out a number of very nice options!","Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2019",AEFX2A4BHG3TUNVA5QUDPFTZB77Q,True,8,Color: Lagoon BluePattern: Speaker
RDTJ4OJICTP06,B07DD3VXRZ,"2.0 out of 5 stars Stopped charging after a month, good sound, bad bluetooth, awkward charge cord",Ammon,2,"The sound was good while it lasted. Issues that may concern potential buyers: 1. My Boom3 stopped charging after about a month. It doesn't come with a power adapter. Their instructions and FAQ say to charge using any USB power adapter. I charged it using a surge protector with built-in USB ports. The tiny white charging indicator light has stopped lighting up. The device can recognize that it's plugged into an outlet, but it won't charge. I can't use the speaker anymore, and when I try to turn it on the voice just says, ""Charging, please wait."" I've tried other plugs and cords, but no luck. I'm just outside the Amazon return window (sucks because I want a refund) so I'll have to check if the company will exchange or credit it under warranty. 2. Was hoping to use it with my PC, but audio keeps cutting out even though speaker is right next to the case. I tried the troubleshooting tips in their FAQ multiple times, followed other user threads and tips, but never got it working well. All other bluetooth products I have (including noise cancelling headphones and testing it with my spouse's JBL speaker) worked fine. I even unpaired and ""forgot"" everything, then reconnected only the the Boom3... still cutting out at regular intervals. This is a pre-built gaming PC and only a few years old, so I really don't think it's the PC's fault. I found numerous people online with similar issues. 3. The cord that comes with this for charging is disappointing. It is micro USB, which means it is awkward to insert. Why not use USB-C on a newer product like this? The cord is solid white, so it looks garish plugged into my black Boom 3. Also, the plug housing is a big square, but the Boom3 charge slot is inside an oval recess - it's very snug and awkward to plug in. Finally, the cord is a flat/ribbon style - it does not want to go where you want it to go.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2022",AF2JAXPNOHN4CQ523YQQWVNAZ5VA,True,2,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

Got my replacement speaker in less than 4 days after speaking with 2nd rep from UE.All good no problems with replacement speaker.However, I think that some items should be brought from the manufacturer & not here.. I have another UE speaker from Amazon & the battery dies so fast. The speaker isn't even a year old.So moving forward, I will buy with more caution..","Reviewed in the United States October 27, 2022",AEGIBVJ2KHWUMBO7MQHWL6AJBNJA,True,1,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker
RIM63S708LP9L,B07DD3VXRZ,3.0 out of 5 stars Not what they used to be,Ivan T,3,"What happened to UE? They used to have great bluetooth speakers. I just read that they were bought by Altec Lansing which explains the drop in sound quality. I owned a UE Boom 1st model and 2nd model and they were amazing. So of course I would buy this model the 3rd gen. Well I was disappointed. First it is not LOUD like the previous models. Bass is sub par but then again UE wasnt really know for heavy bass. So first, I tried the volume at Max outside to see how it was. It was decent but not loud like the other gens. 2nd issue is u will need to download their app to get the most of the speaker but even the app provides minimal improvements. Battery life is better I will say but aound just isnt what it used to be. I would send it back but I gave away my other 2 gens to friends when I ordered this. Do yourself a favor. Buy a bose link instead because this doesnt do it. And the 360 immersive sound that it claims is definitely missing. Disappointed in this speaker to say the least.","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2022",AHDRTT26OA2NWGHZIQ4XNIKAJDRA,True,6,Color: Night BlackPattern: Speaker

R35NBQEDPO572,B07DD3VXRZ,2.0 out of 5 stars Bluetooth connection continues to randomly cut out.,RSTILL,2,"Bluetooth connection to my Boom 3 speakers is sub-par and unacceptable for something in this price range. I own two identical speakers which were bought at separate times and have the issue with both.The problem is that the Bluetooth connection randomly cuts in & out, similar to a popping. Happening in different environments, with different transmitting devices and also in daisy chain connections which is so bad that I can not use multiple speakers together. The problem is not consistent, I have checked the firmware level in the Boom app and it shows it is up to date. My two speakers experience the issue at all distances from the phone which range from sitting on the device, next to the device and then any distance range until it's to far to maintain connection.The issue comes and goes and has been happening more lately which is driving my dissatisfaction and this review. I really wanted this to be a good purchase so have given multiple chances for them to work at an acceptable level.I do not recommend the Boom 3 to anyone unless you get a serious discount and do not expect consistent sound. I'll definitely try another brand when I get so fed up with these that I just donate them away.Side note, it seems like BT can be spiritic on other speakers too so perhaps it's worth it to just get a speaker that offers a hard connection to avoid the frustrating situations when you want consistent sound over portability.","Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2023",AHDQACXK3VYQ6HYHHKFU3PNQSJBQ,True,0,Color: Ultraviolet PurplePattern: Speaker

I’ve bought any number of blue tooth speakers, as a hobby I suppose, always in search of that nirvana sound. They’ve ranged from really small Fugoo units (with unbelievably good sound) to paired floor standing auditorium behemoths that will blow your contacts out. IMO, the UE Boom 3’s are not only a good value, they are superlative in sound from low to high ranges at easy and medium volume. Great for voice, too, e.g. podcasts. I have 2 paired and will likely buy another pair (stereo is nice) for another room.I recently tried the UE Megablast and they don’t hold a candle to to crispness and range of the Boom 3’s. They’re loud and have some nice control features but for sound, IMO the 3’s are the best by far, and uncannily the least expensive of over 10 other brands, up to $300. Unless you’re filling a large room with loud music I’d say the Boom is the best speaker in it’s portable class.

Before I did this, the battery never got past 20%. I looked on the internet and that seems to be a common problem that is fixed by a firmware update, which requires the app. To me, that is a shady practice. People should download the app if they *want*, not because they literally have no choice because the battery indicator is broken without it.

That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AHS6VNLQVHWZLOI3RZ6ZXUWPK4OA,False,12,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability.

It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn’t say it’s the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I’m interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it’s sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It’s minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a “better” speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don’t complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it’s the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you’ll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don’t even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it’s kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
RCS6YZDDME20Y,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars The Pill punches far above it's weight class!!,Brian Severn,5,"Beats Pill (2024) is a high quality product, from the Apple'esque packaging, to the incredible sound output from this small [tiny?] Bluetooth speaker. Incredibly easy to use, connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races.This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can, albeit longer. It has a pre-attached teather that seems strong enough. Claims to be IP67 water resistant. It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB-C charging cable (USB-C YAY!!!). They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other ""party"" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest ""party"" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AGMUT4BKXZBD5PKSMOD2QHVHSKZA,False,1,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

There's support for both Apple and Android too which is nice.Sound quality is superb as expected too. Sharp highs and nice thick, booming bass. It definitely leans to a heavier bass sound, which is fine as the end result is still really balanced and crisp.The verdict? A triumphant return for the Beats Pill 🔥","Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2024",AGUNDWUBZ43QVKTJIDCCLWKVJZGA,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R2W2XN52WGT97C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you. If that's the case, give it a try today!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AGN7FGMJLQ4WZBWMAZMMJYJOFPSQ,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

There is no dedicated power button, and in fact there are no instructions anyplace in the Apple/Beats ecosystem that tell you how to turn it off. (Push the Action button for more than 1, but less than 1.8 seconds.... how dumb is that?) With only 4 buttons, there are too many button sequence combos to remember. Seriously, a volume up/down AND a track up/down would have made life so much easier.All in all, this is a nice sounding Bluetooth speaker, with some good features, let down with a dumb user interface.

In any case, the sound quality that comes out is full and rich including low-end.

RMUYYKJ5WTA8Q,B099TJGJ91,4.0 out of 5 stars The sound is awesome but...,HB,4,"It's a Bose so I expected high quality audio and the speaker does that. It's compact and that's part of the issue. It tips over very easily as the base is rather narrow. Second, the battery life leaves a bit to be desired. It's not as long as other speakers I have had but it's decent. I wish the bright white/blue lights were red or could be turned off. It gives off just enough light to be bothersome if you truly need a dark room to sleep. Forget using the app, all it does is connect and you don't really need it to even do that. It wouldn't control anything on this speaker. Lastly, why is it talking? I don't need it to tell me the battery level or that my device is disconnected. I don't need it to speak at all. It's rather annoying bc if you disconnect and don't turn it off, it promptly reminds you. Spooked the hell out of me several times. It gets 4 stars bc audio wise it's absolutely on point as expected. It's the little details that are missing that list a star. Would I buy again?

I'm a klutz and I expect I'll knock this over or to the ground at any point. Does not seem sturdy in that capacity. Otherwise it's a thick and dense little speaker.Functions as it's supposed to. Charged well when I got it. I can hear it from the other room when I walk away and it's got a nice clear quality to the speaker so far. The charging cord that came with it was quite short but functional. The speaker and instructions are insistent about downloading a useless connection application. Seems like another way to advertise more speakers or to sell user data. It was irritating enough, I almost rated this less because of it.Speaker will not connect to my phone via Bluetooth unless I allow the speaker access to contact information.

I don’t consider myself an audiophile, but I do listen to music religiously — 100k+ hours annually — and I can appreciate a crisp sounding speaker with nuance. This speaker lacks the nuance. It’s not terribly loud in my opinion, even on full volume in my small apartment. However, it is durable, and I love that it’s waterproof. Upon further research, I discovered that Bose is actually NOT worth the value for the money — many audiophiles recommend purchasing from another brand, as these speakers can be made for less than $50 and sold for $400+. Initially I purchased the Bose Soundlink MAX and another Flex (product listed here) as well, in hopes of amplifying the sound as well as achieving stereo sound in my apartment.After doing some research, I returned the Soundlink Max and one of the Flex speakers as well. I purchased some ELAC speakers instead for HOME use, and kept one of the Bose Flex speakers for shower use and traveling, as I spend a lot of time on the beach and this is dust and drop resistant. I purchased this on Prime Day for $99 before tax. I would NOT say it’s worth $150 full price. The battery is not great. I can leave it charging overnight and it dies with moderate use before the day is over. Mediocre in performance overall.It’s worth nothing that when I purchased the Soundlink Max from Amazon, the box itself clearly states that the speaker comes from Bose “RETURNS AND REPLACEMENTS.” I believe the speakers sold on sale are probably speakers that were defected or returned by other customers.

R3IFEE9PNIJYGE,B0B5VHRX7F,4.0 out of 5 stars Big and Heavy! Won't Be Using Them For Much Longer!,Ruth,4,"I've struggled with over-the-ear headphones in the past. I have an average to large sized head for a woman, but have been consistently irritated with how far nearly ever pair of headphones sit on my face.I did a lot of research to try and find the perfect pair of headphones, and really do enjoy the audio quality, noise cancellation, and ability to customize the tone of the audio in the app to maximize my listening experience, but after 7 months, the cons are outweighing the pros.These are just too big, even on the smallest end of the adjustable band setting. They slide back and forth on my head, and the ear cushions nearly reach my jaw. This makes my face appear bloated, which isn't the end of the world, BUT more importantly and painfully, the cushions put a large amount of pressure on my jaw. It starts off barely noticeable, becomes uncomfortable, and then ends up painful. I tried my sister-in-law's Bose QuietComfort headphones, and for $100 more, you get even better sound quality and noise cancelling effects, AND they are so light on your head and have a much broader spectrum of head sizes they can fit! I barely felt them when I had them on.If you can hold off and put down another $100, I think you should look into the QuietComfort. Unless you have a larger head and don't mind the feeling of constant pressure on your jaw. I'm glad these work for so many people, but I'm going to have to sell these and save for the QuietComfort!","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2024",AFNMTZ5P3BS7VEFECHKBI2YJKSWA,True,1,Color: BlackSize: Medium

It's not that I don't recommend them. For their original price, but a $50 discount isn't bad, right? and they almost always put them on sale, you just have to be a little attentive. Having clarified that I can talk about my experience with these headphones. For my birthday they gave me the Soundcore Life Q30 which I really liked but I decided to make the switch to the Q45. When I received them, the first thing I noticed was that the pads were wider, which prevented my ears from touching the headphones, but don't worry because that's not a bad thing, on the contrary, you feel like you're not wearing anything. The sound is better than the Q30 and the noise cancellation too. The battery is so good that you can go a week without charging them, although it is a plus that the Q30 also has along with fast charging. Something that I missed in these Q45s was the touch area on the right side that the Q30s have to activate transparency but it is not something serious. By the way, I dropped them once from a height of 1.5 meters or so and absolutely nothing happened to them.","Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2024",AETDEBCLKBCWGFVQ3WBB26BG4K5Q,True,0,Color: BlackSize: Medium

I can clearly hear not just the highs and lows, but the mid range is noticeable as well. The only complaint I have is that the earpads (ear cups) cause my ears to sweat quickly, even though I only use them whilst relaxing in bed listening to my music. It should be noted that all headphones I have used have the protein leather covered ear cups. I have oily skin and no matter what I do, I sweat and sometimes get acne as well. I have to clean them before each use to help prevent acne, but it still happens. This is NOT a manufacturers defect since almost ALL headphones have the same type of ear cups. If I can find some cooling gel type ear cups for these that fit properly, then these headphones would be perfect. I highly recommend these headphones, especially for the price.

R9Q3A4VVNXOJ3,B0B5VHRX7F,5.0 out of 5 stars Compare to the Bose Ultra and Sony M4 at twice the price,ZenReader,5,"I used a pair of Bose Ultra's on a trip to Europe and found the ANC stellar. Sound quality is a personal experience but they delivered the ""Bose"" sound -clear, rounded, no peaks and valleys. Its a No surprise offering. I got the Sony M4's late and ended up buying the Soundcore to fill a travel gap. At half the price I was pleasantly surprise at the sound quality of the Soundcore -the sound has a much fuller ""sound stage"" than the Bose (more open). I returned the Bose for the Sony offering after reading the reviews. I find the Soundcore very comfortable and the controls easily reached. ANC is above average, better than good but not Sony/Bose level. The one thing about the Bose/Sony is their ability to block ambient noise without ANC turned on. Since the Soundcore does not have the level of ambient blocking, less quality materials I think it starts off at a disadvantage. But at $149 it does the job on airplanes while delivering a very pure sound. The Sony M4 is more refined and I find the sound warmer than the M5. Again its a personal taste thing. If your looking for a decent wireless headset, pure sound, great battery -Soundcore delivers. If you have other Bose products and like its sound pay double and go Bose Ultra. I kept the Sony and am still finding my way around them --they're a lot more techy which I kind of like.","Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2024",AFCAOU36WNQYWE33ZZU7LISDBEOQ,True,2,Color: BlackSize: Medium

RFYI9GTBSJ75X,B0B5VHRX7F,5.0 out of 5 stars Active Noise Cancelling really works!,Kindle Customer,5,"The Anker Soundcore Space Q45 headphones were purchased for my almost 83 year old husband hoping the active noise cancelling feature would help him when he flies on commercial aircraft. He has tinnitus and his ears ring constantly after flying. He is not a techie guy, so he needed headphones that would be easy to use, no frills necessary, just an auxiliary cable to attach to his m3p player or allow him to watch an in-flight movie.I researched Sony, Bose, Beats and other medium-to-high end headphones but they were more than he needed, plus the cost was a consideration. Some only seemed to be Bluetooth which wouldn’t work for him and were eliminated.The Anker Soundcore Space Q34 received high ratings for their price point. Amazon offered them at a special price; the carrying case, charging cable and aux cable were included so I thought I would give them a try for our upcoming trip. Since he does not use a smart phone, I added the Anker App to my phone so I could make adjustments for him.I am happy to report that the active noise cancelling feature worked for him, cutting out almost all the airplane engine noise! So if you are someone looking for a reasonable price headphones with active noise cancelling, I suggest you look at the many reviews about the Q45 and seriously consider them.

But the Q45s have brought a whole new, top notch, low cost headphone to the market, even crushing Anker's former models!PROS:- Price! I've purchased at least 10 different headphones in this price range, only to return them or have them break within a year- Sound! Excellent for the price range. Even phone calls are OK. There IS an EQ you can download for your phone which helps a lot!- 3 modes for background noise: (1) ANC - Active noise canceling, (2) Normal and (3) Transparency - so you can listen to your music while amplifying what is going on around you. Great for walking in traffic, public transport, watching TV and listening for your laundry or kids etc.- ANC: Amazing - it will blow your mind! My husband can be vacuuming, and I can easily hear what I'm watching!!- DUAL connections: I can have these connected to my phone as well as my TV/Computer. I can watch a movie, and answer my phone. The headsets will automatically turn off my TV and switch to my phone as soon as I accept a call. Love this feature!- AUTO turn off: I can listen to meditation streaming and fall asleep, knowing these will turn off automatically after not receiving an incoming signal after roughly 30 min - 1 hr. Great battery saver!- BATTERY LIFE is outstanding: I believe it's marketed as 45 hours? I would say that's roughly what I get. Although, I use the ANC all the time, so it may be a little lower. Good news is they charge super quickly with the 3.0 USB plug!- CONTROLS are very simple, easy to use, and can do almost anything. Minor issue: I have not figured out how to jump to the next song/video in my playlist. There may be a way, but I'm so happy with everything else, I don't even care!- COMFORT: I use mine mostly to watch TV/Movies streaming. I can easily spend a lazy Sunday with these on all day and NOT have any complaints about comfort. The padding in the ears is TOP NOTCH, the headpiece padding is good, and the adjustability of the height is wonderful. I find the tension which they squeeze on my ears to be good enough to feel snug, but not so strong that it will cause a headache or 'ear fatigue' after wearing for an entire day.- Did I mention PRICE?: You CANNOT do any better for the price - trust me, I've tried! Even purchased a couple of the name brands (Sony, Sennheiser, Cowin, etc) at the lower 'Refurbished' price making them the same price as the Anker Q45s, and none of them were as good as these! (I did keep my Cowins as back ups - but still not as good).- Compared to other ANKER products: I had the Q30s (they were OK) and the Q35s (a little better) and the new Q45s are such a huge improvement!- RANGE: I live in a 2 story townhome. I can go anywhere in my home, and even a few feet outside, and still have reception. I would say after about 50 feet, it becomes a little spotty.CONs: (I don't really have any, but maybe for some of you?):- Because the pads are made out of pleather, I wouldn't use these to work out with. They would be very hot, and the sweat would probably make them slippery.- If you're looking for a set of headphones to travel with a lot, these aren't bad. They do fold up, and swivel about 70 degrees on each headset. I know other brands may do a little better here. I use mine at home, so I don't have an issue with this.- I wish the EQ app was a little better, and I could load on my computer rather than just my phone. I probably can, I'm just too lazy to figure it out?","Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2023",AELXNQ4WLN3SGWBXZPHR4D2SBYAA,True,171,Color: WhiteSize: Medium

Everything was working great in all my tests except in transparency mode there was some squeaking sound kind of like markers on a whiteboard from the right side. I opened a case from the mobile app and had a replacement at my door in less than a week. The replacement appears to be a slightly newer model (Before: A3040011 FW: 6.34 vs After: A3040012 FW: 2.34) which has slightly thicker ear pads. No issues with the replacement product so I'm satisfied. I got my kids renewed versions of the Space Q45 which is how I knew the squeaking sound wasn't normal.I found the richness of the audio to be a little less than my previous headphones (Wyze Headphones). After going through the HearID profile set up process it improved the sound quality IMO. I'd also recommend looking into the ""Alternative A2DP Driver"" for Windows which enables LDAC support and improves the audio quality. On Linux (Fedora 39) LDAC just worked out of the box, which is +1 for Linux.","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2024",AFC2DW2MHHQBNBZV2PMV6MWQNDSQ,True,2,Color: BlackSize: Medium

High-frequency noise (such as people talking, or radio, or silverware clattering) is, at best, a little muffled by the ANC. On the other hand, it does a pretty good job of blocking out lower frequency noise, like the hum of a refridgerator, or an engine.So if what you want the ANC for is blocking out sounds in an office with a lot of chatter, this is not going to do much for you. And on an airplane it may block out the sound of the engines, but if a kid starts screaming, this ANC won't save you.","Reviewed in the United States June 21, 2024",AEBW2VMORVARO4E4W4NOJOQJVX3Q,True,1,Color: BlueSize: Medium

I found the stock bass to be VERY heavy, but after it was much cleaner and more manageable.And they don't look like something an alien designed, so I'll be able to take them to the office without getting the side eye from the boss.May end up buying a pair for my wife.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AGLB5ZTVPBJAY3DVFD5EQ5NTWEFQ,True,1,Color: BlueSize: Medium
R32Z9BC0P87US7,B0B5VHRX7F,4.0 out of 5 stars Must do software updates to get sound quality,TeaDragon,4,"Edit to add: After using these for a while, they developed a terrible funky stench. I've never had this with any other headphones, on-ear or over-ear. There is really no air flow at all, and just going for walks puddles up the sweat in there, which these materials seem to have no resistance to. These headphones still sound great, still work great, but I find myself not using them, because after a little while that horrible smell comes back and becomes unbearable. So, warning, if you are going to walk around with these in the summer, look for other options.Quick edit to add: These headphones intensely stink of chemical/plastic smell out of the box. After 4 days, they no longer make the entire room stink, but they still stink if you put them on your head or sniff them. Seems like it will air out _eventually_, but be aware. It's intense and unpleasant.TL;DR: If losing multi-device connection and some battery life isn't worth it to get good sound, then DO NOT buy these, as they aren't for you.I had a set of UE 9000 headphones that lasted a decade before refusing to charge any batteries any longer. I tried some other form factors, but wanted to go back to a set of cans with large drivers for maximum sound quality. After 3 days, here's an initial review.Terrible sound out of the box (but fixable):Taking the Soundcore Space Q45s out of the box and connecting to my Android phone, I was horrified by the terrible audio quality compared to the ancient APTX codec UE 9000 pair. I mean, crackling on mellow layered music like Enya. Static on the soft parts of other music. No matter what music player EQ I tried, it was just awful. I mean, just terrible in a shocking way. I couldn't believe it could be worse sounding than my decade-old bluetooth headphones after all of the rave reviews. Then I realized my phone's Bluetooth connection to them was NOT using the LDAC codec I had expected, but AAC. Oh.Fixing the sound quality:Fixing this required installing the Soundcore app on the phone, then doing a firmware update multiple times (with multiple headphones reboots), then changing the setting in the app to enable ""Preferred audio quality"". This then updates the firmware/settings in the device one _again_ and suddenly it's like you have a different set of headphones! Really, you sacrifice the multiple device connection feature and some battery life, but it is worth it! I bought these hoping for Hi-Res music quality, and before these updates, I definitely did not have it. If losing multi-device connection and some battery life isn't worth it to get good sound, then DO NOT buy these, as they aren't for you.Call quality:People tell me I sound good and clear, but I find if I speak softly I sometimes need to repeat myself.Controls:Real buttons, hurray! Controls work well, but while you can skip tracks, there's no built in way to fast forward or skip forward _within_ a song. You can replace the track skip with a fast forward type action inside the settings of some individual apps. Not having this built into the heaphone controls is one real weakness of the Space Q45.Ergonomics:I'm accustomed to large cans. The UE9000 pair were far heavier than these (more metal). I wear an XL or 7 1/2 hat size, and these do work. The bottom of the cups come further down than any wired or wireless cans I've ever used. Just about to the bottom of my jaw joint. The band also sits further back on the top of the head than most, and the cups tilt forward. Takes some getting accustomed to. At first, I tried to wear them positioned more like other headphones, but this made my ears sore due to pressing the earlobes down. I think I have the positioning figured out, so time will tell. The cups also seem to be less deep, so that the center of the cups touch my ears a bit.Also, they will make your ears hot/sweaty more than some others.","Reviewed in the United States October 17, 2022",AF2KYH6SZ6VZXPETKNVJTA2BLJDQ,True,39,Color: BlackSize: Medium
R3L7BO6XPTWMVA,B0B5VHRX7F,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent ANC headphones for $100,justcuz,5,"I bought these 1.5 years ago on a Black Friday sale. I’m not an audiophile but I did want good sound and noise canceling. When I’m around the house, I like to read and watch YouTube videos. I wanted ANC headphones that would tune out the gas leaf blowers that run nearly every day near our home… they drive me up the wall! These headphones do a great job of tuning out the leaf blowers and allow me to listen to classical music or a YouTube without all that aggravating noise. They also do a good job of blocking out conversations I don’t want to hear while I’m reading.I own several Anker products and find they all deliver good quality at a fair price point. I can’t see spending $300 for a pair of headphones. Maybe Bose and Sony are better, but I can’t see how they justify 3X the price. In my opinion they can’t be that much better.","Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2024",AGOEBKUMOM477U3VFP4UQ4P3LCQQ,True,2,Color: BlackSize: Medium
R2EQF3KIZBQLFA,B0B5VHRX7F,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, great battery life, overall excellent, but didnt work for my picky self",Dea,4,"I love the soundcore Q# line, i have a pair of Q30s that i wore out and decided to upgrade to the Q45s.Battery life is amazing, i love that i never have to worry if they are charged or not. Sound quality is great, i love the app with the EQ option. I can customize the audio so that my audio books sound like theres someone sitting next to me reading. They have a variety of EQ presets to choose from (including spoken word, but inchose to tweak mine a bit) and you can make multiple custom EQ things.My biggest qualm is the noise cancelling. It is freaking great if you dont wear glasses and you hold your head still so that it doesnt break the seal of the earcup. But i wanted a pair that i can wear at work while im doing stuff and moving and wearing glasses. The ANC changes whenever i move my head and that seal is broken, which is multiple times a minute. I would have been happy with paying more for this pair of headphones for the extended battery and getting rid of the touch switch option! (Q30s offer a “feature” where it switches to transparency mode when the right earcup is touched. The fact that the Q45s dont have it is one of the reasons i upgraded)But it feels silly to upgrade just because i dont want a “feature, and the difference between 40 and 50 hours isnt that huge. Since the ANC keeps fading in and out frequently and distractingly, i decided to return them. But just because they dont work for me doesnt mean they arent great.","Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2024",AE7V4PEL7YQBD3CTZ63MXA3CSPIA,True,3,Color: BlackSize: Medium

R33EHS7GSUWTJ6,B0B5VHRX7F,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing value for money,Richard Fichera,5,"I can't speak to the longevity of these headphones, but my initial impression is very positive. They are not quite as good as the expensive Sony headphones that I gave to my son, but they were on sale for $100, almost exactly 25% of the cost of the Sony units. The noise cancellation is subjectively excellent, sound quality is more than adequate, and the controls are also adequate, with easy to find and manioulate on/off, volume and NC mode. The ""transparency mode"" is pretty good in a quiet environment, not sure how it will fare on an airplane.Build quality seems good, with some obvious compromises in padding and feel of materials to get down to the their price point. For my purposes, occasional use at home and a few times a year on airplanes, they should last me for quite a while.Anker appears to be making strong efforts to climb up the food chain and distance itself from other prolific makers of peripherals and power units (to name a few of their products), and if these Q45s (playing shamelessly upon Bose's nomenclature) are an indicator of their trajectory, the likes of Bose and Sony should be very concerned.Anker has several NC headphones, and I chose these after listening to reviews that highlighted their slightly better NC and microphone should I ever want to sue them with my phone. Unless you are ultra-discerning about sound quality, you will probably enjoy having an extra $300 more or less in your pocket and these Anker headphones on your head rather than having the highest end Bose or Sony headphones. Evven at their full list price of $139 they will remain a great value for the money.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2024",AF4PSALYPCAJTKS4UBXG3Y4A377A,True,3,Color: BlackSize: Medium

I tried:Sennheiser HD 450SEJBL Tour ONESony WH-XB910NTOZO HT2Plus a few other onesThe close to fitting was the TOZO HT2, but the depth of the earcups was too shallow for me and the speaker rested uncomfortable on my ear. The Sennheiser and Sony were hilariously small, the Sennheiser is simple not an over ear headphone for anyone over the age of 6 >_>The Soundcore Q45 fit fully around my ears, and have enough depth that the speaker portion does not rest on my ear. I have worn them for about a week now and they have been comfortable for me for hours of wear.The sound out of the box is a little flat and neutral. There is an app that has an EQ and a sound personalization wizard which seemed to work well for me. The app also lets you adjust the strength of the noise canceling, which I like because very strong noise canceling can make me a bit dizzy after a while. The headphones let you directly turn off noise canceling completely with one of the buttons.After so many failed attempts to find something that fits me(and lets me turn off ANC...looking at you bose) I'm quite happy with these.","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2024",AE3Z3UG63657O4M4XC2YR7TC2VKQ,True,3,Color: BlackSize: Medium

RK9HG2XUFDVDZ,B0B5VHRX7F,4.0 out of 5 stars (updated impressions: Sound is much better wirelessly) Not very good sounding at all,M. Kinn,4,"Initial impressions are:ANC isn't much of anything. Hard to tell the difference between off and on.Sound quality isn't all that good in wireless mode in. When I first powered them on they required a firmware update. When I tried to turn on LDAC, they required another firmware update. And after subsequently enabling LDAC, I listened for a few minutes. The sound seemed better, but I didn't listen long in wireless. I wanted to get to the wired mode...I plugged these into my FiiO Q11 DAC/amp connected to my laptop with Amazon Music UltraHD streaming and PC audio set to 32 bit, 192Kh (studio quality).Music seems like it's just at the plane of the drivers rather than having a wide soundstage. Bass and especially sub bass doesn't seem to be tightly controlled.Yeah, I just pulled up a song I'm very familiar with and the sound is flat and lifeless. Nevertheless, I'm going to see if burn-in will help...(updated impressions):After burn-in, the sound didn't improve for wired mode so I shelved these Q45. However, I chose to pull them back out and use them in wireless mode and they do sound better.When I first unboxed them I listened to them in wireless mode only briefly to check out the ANC mainly. Wired mode is what I most interested in because of the purity of a wired sound. I gave that up after trying to make them sound better. Nevertheless, I decided to give them more listening time in wireless mode and am finding that they do sound better. The bass is not as muddy and the overall sound is clearer and crisper with a much better soundstage.Their good qualities are:Comfort - they have properly sized ear cups that fit my large ears wellBuild - they are built very well and feel premiumSound in wireless mode (Bluetooth) - using the LDAC codec, they are much better soundingPrice - they are priced well below other brands that offer the high quality build and constructionThe things not so good (very few)ANC - I still can't tell much of a difference between on and off. There are cheaper headphones that provide much better ANCWired listening mode - Their overall sound is overwhelmed by muddy, bass that is not tightly controlledand their soundstage isn't very goodIf you buy these, buy them for their wireless performance.

I found these to be quite comfortable, but they don’t stay in place if you ‘bend over’. The noise cancelling is not as strong as I expected, hence the 4 star rating.

The case it comes in and the way its orientated is a little awkward. The headphones themselves are flawless. Great noise cancelling to the point when I'm vacuuming I had to check to see if the vacuum was still on. The fit is super comfortable and have ran these headphones for 4 hours straight without it even touching the battery. I'm so glad I bought these instead of Beats.

Always solid.,HJeffK,5,"I have had and owned so many great ear buds and headphones over the years from Sony, Bose, M&D, Sennheiser, and everyone in between. Anker has always been my go to budget brand for peripherals and occasionally buds and cans. I owned the Q35's and loved them. My last Sony cans were appropriated on a divorce. Long story, but for another day. I had a recent business trip to Hawaii and was bringing a date so I gave her my Q35's and bought these, thinking that 9 hours of use would be better served with cans instead of in ear buds. I was so right. Like the 35's, these are not nearly as good as their big name competitors, but they are still really good and are a five star value overallIn terms of sound, these are really good. You can stream LDAC with the right device, but even without, these are very good. Lots of bass with good separation from the mids and highs. Not world class but you will like listening to these. The noise cancelling these do is really good. They wipe out plane noise and all but the most sudden noises. The battery life is awesome. You can expect over 45 hours no matter how loud you go. They are comfortable for long periods as well. Plus, big bonus over the 35's, call quality is as good or better than anything I have ever used including Sony and Bose. These just generally do everything above average or better.If you have the money to drop on the latest Sony or Bose cans, do it. They are better and worth the upgrade. However, most folks will love these and never miss the better options for the money. Anker Sound core is a great company that makes great things for a fair price. The Q45’s are no exception.

After a couple of more expensive and slightly better sound-profile models from major brands, two things became apparent: (1) Headphones designed to be 'stable' for exercise, etc., are going to be less comfortable--they squeeze your head like a vice. (2) ANC implementation tends to be weak or weird (pressure, unevenness, etc.) on these higher end audio units. Not tried: Bose. But thorough reviews suggest the sound profile for them is not all that great for what they cost--and you get maybe -5db more in ANC overall.Bottom line: Q45 is super comfortable and the ANC is both substantial and not weird. I don't use them for exercise (that's what buds are for), and I think they would tend to fall off or just move around too much if I did. But these are near-perfect 'sit and listen' headphones. At half or less the price of a pair of Bose ANC headphones, the buy decision for Q45 is a no brainer for my use case.","Reviewed in the United States March 19, 2024",AFUWAKEV4TGMISJI5QCRH7BENOQA,True,0,Color: WhiteSize: Medium

R3F4NTDVP5DAT3,B0B5VHRX7F,"2.0 out of 5 stars Good Comfort, Terrible Sound Quality, Amazing Noise Cancelling (ANC)",James,2,"When looking for headphones on the internet (especially wireless) you are bound to hear about how great these are. these ""professional"" reviewers on sites such as YouTube and even RTINGS boast about how great these are, even comparing them to headphones triple the price, even here on the amazon reviews all you read is positive reviews. From the looks of it these headphones are the best headphones, but are they? Today that is what we are going to find out!After reading all of the great things about these headphones I wanted to purchase a pair for traveling and listening to music when I'm not at my desk. My daily driver headphones are the Audio Technica M40x they are a great pair of headphones with fantastic sound quality but I thought the Q45s would be great for plane flights and things of that sort since the ATH M40x have a long cable(1 Meter long) which makes them difficult and cumbersome to use on-the-go. So I placed an order for the glorious Q45s and eagerly awaited them to grace my household with their (alleged) glory.A little less than a week after I ordered them, they finally arrived. I excitedly open them, knowing that I was about to experience their glorious ""High-Res Audio WIRELESS"" and ""INCREDIBLE SOUND LOVED BY 20 MILLION+ PEOPLE"". I eagerly bestow them upon my head, connect them to my Android device, download the companion app(which is totally not spy-ware), load my favorite band, ""REDUCE NOISE BY 98%"", and activate the music!The Innovative Double-Layer Diaphragm Drivers have been activated! I then realised my music sounded like it was being played out of a 20$ speaker, and I was being submerged under a Motel 6 pool...okay, this is not ""Hi-Res Audio WIRELESS"", No need to fret! maybe the volume just needs to be increased. I then realize that the volume is already set at maximum. This is just how these sound. NO! This is not what the reviewers promised! They claimed the audio quality is best in class, This is WORST IN CLASS AUDIO!My ATH-M40x which are significantly lower cost then these ""Premium"" pair of headphones have at least triple the volume(loudness) and the sound quality is much better. Why do all the reviewers love the Q45s? The sound quality is TERRIBLE. Though I must concede that the Q45s are very comfortable and the ANC is great! When I activate ""NOISE CANCELLING REDUCE NOISE BY 98%"" the noise does really get reduced by at least 98%, maybe a little more. with the ""NOISE CANCELLING REDUCE NOISE BY 98%"" active I can't hear the rumble of my very loud A/C. I am impressed by everything BUT the sound quality. Even the build quality is decent!Though unfortunately, they fail at their primary function as headphones, that is to produce quality sound. I was not exaggerating earlier when describing the sound. the sound is very muddy but somehow also very echo-y sounding. The Q45s also fail at producing sound at a reasonable volume. The volume of the Q45s is less than 20% of my ATH M40x. To be fair to Anker, I do use an amplifier when operating my M40x, But on the contrary the amplifier I use is not powerful at all. Maybe very low volumes is normal with wireless headphones(?) this is my first pair of wireless headphones so I am not entirely sure. But that's besides the point.It is due time I provide a conclusion to this mess... I do not recommend the Q45s. They, as stated earlier fail at their primary function of producing quality sound, however Anker has done a good job on all other aspects of this headphone. Comfortable ear-pads, decent build quality, Fantastic ANC implementation, creative design, though they do look strange when worn but I appreciate the creativity of the unusual design. These are quite a strange headphone, its like Anker spent their effort on everything but the sound quality. I do wonder why they decided to go down this route when designing them? I think Anker should just stick to making cables, they make quality cables!As for me I will attempt to return them to hopefully get my money back. I hope my review provided you with an alternative perspective on these consumer headphones. I wish you luck on your search for headphones! Before you go, I suggest considering purchasing the ATH-M40x or any other pair of wired headphones instead of these. Just beware that you may need to get an amplifier to get the full sound out of them(Don't worry, There is a lot of amplifiers to choose from here on amazon).","Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2023",AHKRDBWIV7LE4VJ6V7QFEOAKCQMA,True,15,Color: BlackSize: Medium

R9UA6NHWSUPOH,B0B5VHRX7F,3.0 out of 5 stars Anker Space Q42 ANC is average,J.M.,3,"Even an average ANC helps a lot when listing to others during a phone call, or a conference, or watching a video while in a noisy environment.I compared Anker Space Q45 with Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II and Sony WH-1000XM5 headset.I used the steady noise of a running faucet for reference.My perception is that at a 50 dB noise level, Bose cuts out 98% of the noise, Q45 cuts out 70%, Sony XM5 95%. This type of noise is very low, like an AC vent, but can be a distraction when one has to focus briefly. I highly recommend using an ANC on long flights since it reduces fatigue.Fun fact: I tried wearing Sony headset on top of the Bose earbuds. It is uncomfortable but it can silence 60 dB. Flushing of a toilet, 75 dB, sounds like a gentle murmur ;-)Things to consider:Q45 is 2-3 times cheaper than Sony XM5. Q45 can't remove a steady low volume noise of AC vent. Q45 ANC is marginally better than a Jabber's headset.I would caution to consider the quality of the microphone in a noisy environment. Most reviews demonstrate that Sony XM5 is the best. I found that the microphone in the Bose earbuds perform poorly in a very noisy environment. I didn't test Q45 microphone.Bose usability/connectivity is beyond horrible, but when it works, it has the best noise cancellation.It is possible to sleep with the earbuds.Wearing any earbuds for many hours every day can cause ear skin irritation.Wearing any headset for more than 1 hour causes ears to get too hot.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AF5YA3PJLCUWXD3IPHU2JKRNB5SA,True,2,Color: BlackSize: Medium

The case is very nice to have and amazing that it’s included at this price. The plastic does feel a little less quality but it does not take away from the sound at all. The ear pads are very cushy, which is great because I wear glasses and I feared it would bother me, it doesn’t at all. I’ve worn these on my commute to work, and out walking, even wearing for more than an hour at a time; they remained comfortable and light weight.

R261Q9H0KIJFAA,B0B5VHRX7F,4.0 out of 5 stars Good for the price,lawrence,4,"I had the top of the line Sonys for about 2 years. The x4 model now replaced by the x5, which I just ordered today. I am returning these. These were excellent for the price, but I was so used to the Sonys. Here are the biggest differences I found. First off, noise canceling wasn't really close. I am comparing the same experiences at the same places and this is what I really missed. An example, when flying (I fly 4 to 8 times a month) I can still hear the safety announcement coming through, I use that as an example because it's always about the same volume. It also didn't fully cancel out the noise of the landscapers which drives me crazy. Crying babies on the plane and the guy in the gym talking loudly into his headset, they all come through enough to bother me. With the Sonys, I heard none of that. Part of it seemed to be the better seal on the Sonys. The foam around the ears is better. The next thing that made a difference was the controls. The Sony is a quick swipe anywhere on the outer shell, up or down (volume) front and back (advance /replay track) when working out, this is important to me. I can make the desired adjustments without occupying my hands for more than a second. No searching for the little buttons, no pushing them the wrong way. If you are doing cardio and your hands are on the equipment or even running on a treadmill, this will probably make a difference to you. The Sony was better in the comfort category also. Mostly the top head band. The Sony has more padding, you never feel the metal frame, not so with these. And lastly, the sound quality. It got close enough after tinkering with the eq and turning on some setting (I forgot the name) but it still wasn't as good as the Sony. I never adjusted the Sony EQ. Never had a problem with the sound that I wanted to adjust it. I don't know how much background noise was a factor here, but when I was relaxing just listening to the music, I noticed the difference, the Sonys just are an amazing experience. You can close your eyes and think you are in a concert hall. For the most part, working out, on the plane, listening to movies, there wasn't much difference in the sound quality. These do have better battery life, but the Sonys last all day, just not 3 days or so like these. If I never had the Sonys I would be thrilled with these. For 1/3 of the price they are 2/3rds as good. It just depends on your budget and what you want from them.","Reviewed in the United States January 22, 2023",AGDA3Q73MTCUJUHQH2Y7OHEDSB2Q,True,45,Color: BlackSize: Medium
RQJG9JKYK5MYV,B0B5VHRX7F,5.0 out of 5 stars Another quality product from Soundcore,John Richard,5,"For full disclosure, I'll admit I got these as a Black Friday sale for $99, and that does have an impact on my opinion of them, but I do believe they are worth it even at full price.I also own a pair of Sony WH1000XM4s, as well as an older set of XM2s that I gave to my daughter, and I wanted another pair of headphones I can leave in my office, and these seemed to fit the bill. It seems reasonable to compare these to the XM4s.First and fore-most the Sonys ARE nicer. They have a more premium feel, the materials feel higher quality, and they are lighter. The comparison I would make are that the Sonys are like a Mercedes, but these are certainly a Honda or Toyota. The sound is incredible. The signature sound with bass up sounds really good to me, but I have also used the very excellent equalizer, and have them tuned to sound almost exactly like the XM4s. In fact, if you blindfolded me I not sure I would be able to tell the difference between the two.Noise cancelling is terrific. I used them this morning in the gym, and with the NC turned on I could barely hear the overhead music, and as soon as I started my own song I couldn't hear it at all. The transparency also works pretty well. It sounds a little ""tinnier"" than the Sony, but seems a bit more sensitive. Wearing them around the office I could hear everyone well.Some folks have complained about the lack of padding on the headband, but I've been wearing them for 3 hours and barely notice the headband. To be fair, I do have a lot of hair, and might be a problem if you're bald. They stay in place well, even at the gym, but I have a pretty big head.In conclusion, these are a terrific purchase that I can highly recommend. the Sonys are also completely worth it, but these Soundcore headphones are serious competitors.Update 5/8/2023:Holy Crap! They just made these even better. Latest firmware upgrade added the HearID! This is one of the features on the Liberty 3 pro earbuds (which I also LOVE) which makes them sound so good. I updated the firmware, did the hearing test and my God what a difference. I A-B tested with the XM4s and the Soundcores are clearly better. I may be able to tweak the Sonys to sound the same, but the HearID addition makes these cans an even better value. Might switch the Sonys to be my office headphone and use these as my ""main duty"" headphones. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2022",AFVJX66B742OCN6457EXIR2VP7XA,True,26,Color: BlueSize: Medium

I could put this on without Music Playing and Hear Nothing! like annoying air conditioning sounds and other people in my house Lol but Yeah That's a Pro!Cons: The Bad thing about these Headphones is that You do have to use an App to edit the sounds in order for them to sound better, another thing I didn’t like is that There is a Mic Button on there, and if you press it, it will only decrease the sound also if you want the loud sounds back you have to plug the charger into it in order to get those loud sounds back! I would have thought it would be better if you can just simply press the on button again on the side of the headphones to get the Loud Sounds back but No! the charger must be plugged into it if you want it to be loud again! And like porky pig said Ba deep ba deep ba deep THAT'S ALL FOLKS! 😂😎😁","Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2022",AEBZ6BWKXKWR6MLHQTS5D3FOJ5ZA,True,27,Color: BlackSize: Medium

R26MJBLU230MV,B0B5VHRX7F,5.0 out of 5 stars Best headphones I've ever had,Sarah M.,5,"I'm writing this review as someone who has never tried Bose QuietComfort or similar, more expensive, noise cancelling headphones, but I can tell you that the Q45 is good enough that I'm not going to bother to search any further.The sound quality is really good. I'm no audiophile, but I'm totally satisfied.The noise cancelling is everything I could ask of it.The passthrough function is a revelation. I use it way more than I thought.The app allows for really significant sound customization. Noise cancelling and passthrough can be tuned for comfort. The equalizer allows me to avoid Android's messy equalizer implementation. The Safe Volume function keeps things in check without distortion if you, like me, are the type that wants to continue to enjoy music in your old age.The headphones are comfortable. I have a big head. Many headphones feel like they have my head in a vise. The Q45s are comfortable for the whole work day and they even have a bit of room to spare for even larger heads.100% satisfied.","Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2024",AHAYIA5NVKY75RCWMCNXSGWXB7JQ,True,1,Color: BlueSize: Medium

The noise on planes have made it impossible for me to enjoy music or movies. These solved the problem. I watched 4 movies during the entire trip and also listened to music. I haven't had much experience with NC, but was amazed by its effectiveness. Sound quality was quite good. Probably not what an audiophile might like, but suited me and I listen to a lot of music from a broad range. There are much more expensive models out there that may do a better job, but I just thought these were great and saved me a few bucks. Time will tell about durability.

R1EXBLSQ8K99SI,B0B5VHRX7F,4.0 out of 5 stars Terrific ANC headphone -but not so much for first time users,Hwang LZ,4,"Just to clarify - This would make a terrific headphones for those who had been wearing ANC headphones a long time, but for someone like me who hasn’t worn ANC headphones before and/or is sensitive to certain sound wave pressure, you might not be accustomed to wearing this, even when it’s on a “Normal mode”.But otherwise, I would definitely recommend this for those who are looking for a new ANC headphones mainly because it does give you three different modes (transparency, normal, and ANC - which not many headphones offer). The previous reviews are on-spot, so I’m not going into too much details. But I will emphasize some things here:1.) Only good for office/commute/traveling only as it does feel slightly loose when I look up and down, so this does not make a good fitness headphones in my opinion.1a.) General fit: [my head circumference is 21 inches] When I first tried it on, it does feel slightly loose but that’s because I have a small head. However, it does feel really comfortable around my ears.2.) Sound waves: This is my first time purchasing and wearing ANC headphones, so I was unaware that ANC uses specific sound waves to cancel out the background noise, so I did feel like a very mild “airplane pressure” and it did make me uncomfortable when I wear it for quite some time, even on the “Normal mode”. My mother was extremely sensitive to it as it she began to develop headaches and congestion after wearing it for a few minutes. So this is something to consider for people who are sensitive to certain sound waves. But she did agree that this was a wonderful headphone, but it just wasn’t suitable for her.Overall, this is really a good quality ANC headphones that I’ve owned so far esp at this pricing. So for those who are looking to save money on a good pair of ANC headphone that includes a travel case, this is the one.","Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2023",AEDM7CLLNGNZI4C4VJKSRXDY6V3A,True,19,Color: BlackSize: Medium

R27Z4QJ5VGAU12,B0B5VHRX7F,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones, Poor Active Noise Canceling","With Love, From Texas",4,"I bought these in February of 2023. I wanted to get a good chance to form an opinion on them before I wrote a review. So here it goes.Comfort: 9/10The ear cups are soft and squishy and easy to wear for and extended period of time even with my glasses on! No headaches from cutting of blood flow around the ears here. The headband does not press into my head even on the tightest setting, bonus for broad headed users! That said, these do slip around if you make jerking motions or look down for too long. But for the most part they stay in place.Sound: 10/10These probably have the best consumer sound. With loads of settings and presets to tweak them to your liking. Can be leveled, crisp and clean if that’s what you need. Or if you’re a bass junkie, you can boost that and rock out via their accompanying app.Battery: 10/10I use these everyday and on a single charge they last me the whole week. I use them at night while putting the baby down to tune out the crying and white noise maker so I can stay calm and collected to be the best mama without getting overwhelmed and over stimulated. And we’ll will get to the noise cancellation next.Noise Cancellation: 5/10In my opinion, for the price, this is where the headphones underperform severely for me. On the highest setting I feel like it just barely takes the edge off loud noises (baby crying, white noise machine, etc)! But for normal things like the low hums of the road, grocery store, conversations at a coffee shop it does a good job at dulling those pretty well! I have not been on a plane with these yet, but I feel like it would be meh at blocking engine noise. So yeah, for me buying these for the sole purpose of tuning out and needing ANC, these are not worth the money. When I can afford to upgrade I’m going straight for Sony.And on a side note I’d you have colored hair, DO NOT BUY WHITE. If you sweat or get out of a shower and put these on with wet hair, the color stains the vinyl and I have yet to discover a way to remove it!","Reviewed in the United States April 21, 2023",AEVFFPR42II6RHZKG4AM2X2ZMB5A,True,8,Color: WhiteSize: Medium

The sound quality and noise cancelation will go toe to toe with headphones multiple times what these cost.

The ear cups twist, but lack the necessary pivot for the top and bottom of the ear cups to both sit correctly without some fiddling.","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2024",AF3IXK6CHYIOADQM3NNI7XRINQ6Q,True,0,Color: BlueSize: Medium

The sound is decent but a little thin. You can play around in the app to adjust the EQ and level of noise cancellation so that was a nice. I personally care a lot about the sound it self and these headphones are nothing close to Sony, Bose, or Sonos over ear headphones. If you’re used to AirPods or any of the higher end brands sound quality you will most likely be disappointed.I ended up getting the Sony - WHCH720N instead as they’re in the same price range and you can tell the sound quality difference immediately.

Asthetics easy 10 out of 10.Now let's get to the honest opinions when sony first announced this this I was definitely overjoyed but definitely said do to the size there has to be a little more hardware such as a tweeter included. Unfortunately the was not the case as pur usual sony overlooked an easy detail. Don't get me wrong this thing sounds good and yes the EQ does help the sound treble and bass can be improved but Ultimately it's just to obvious this could have been better with a tweeter! There is just this sence of slight muffle or just not high enough in terms of volume I have to turn this to about 70% for it to keep up with the charge 5 volume at about 50%. I really like this and wanted it to be greater then it is but 200 does not justify this thing the 2 woofers can easily handle mids with no problem and are ok with highs but seriously sony why no tweeter u have plenty of space in this thing. The defuser works ok the sound doesn't feel super directional but doesn't seem as wide spread as they advertise. U want this to fill your room maximum with the EQ tweaked is the way to do it! Maybe sony was trying to avoid a large amount of distortionion because it is quite minimal at maximum wich is really good! And yes the microphone function is really solid so props to them for that!Enough rambling all in all its a nice sounding well built speaker but 200 ...nah... may return it and buy it back later if I find it for Luke 120-130 ish for that 200 there is definitely bigger to equal size speakers with better performance!

R2ERBUN36N4C82,B08LQNL42Z,4.0 out of 5 stars Bought this instead of the jbl xtreme 3!,H B,4,"If you need a speaker for a vehicle that has no car radio, you'll need at least a 30w speaker that can hold its own bass wise, as vehicle interior size is small, and roadnoise quite often drown out the bass of smaller sized speakers.Initially I had purchased the JBL Extreme 3 speaker, which undeniably sounds much better than this speaker out of the box.However, this speaker has 3 redeeming qualities that made it my preferred device, and 2 additional features that surprised me.1- most importantly is price. At half the price, and me using the xtreme 3 at work, the repeating question on my mind was ""what if this speaker gets stolen, or breaks? Can I really afford to lose a $180-250 speaker like this?"". Hence I started looking around for cheaper alternatives, and stumbled on this soundcore anker boom, which has about the same dimensions as the jbl xtreme 3 (fitting perfectly in the dash cubby holder of my company's Mercedes sprinter van).2- Both the jbl extreme, and the soundcore anker motion boom produce sufficient volume, bass, mids and treble to be used in a car or portable speaker for house parties. I'm probably not convinced they will do for outside (yard) parties by themselves, but that's what surprised me about the motion boom: it has a button to pair it with more speakers, like JBL party mode! Meaning, you can connect 2 speakers together on one device. I didn't know that feature existed on the boom too (it does exist on the boom plus).3- out of the box, I was a bit disappointed by the boom's sound quality. And while it was easy to add bass with the bass button, soundcore's speaker has an app, that allows me to adjust the eq quite nicely. All of a sudden the boom sound quality was nearing the jbl xtreme 3! I got about 90-98% of the sound quality, for half to 1/3rd the price!4- The JBL Xtreme 3 has a rated battery life of about 14 hours, but after 8 hours at moderately louder volumes (75%), the battery indicator was at about 1/3rd, indicating me there's less than 12 hours of music, and less each time the battery degrades. The motion boom has a rated battery life closer to 24 hours, but my experience playing at louder volumes is closer to 14 to 18hours, which can span 2 or 3 workdays. Another win for the boom!It's amazing that the boom can be relatively loud (75% volume), and my 5v 1A usb charger can keep up with the charge, meaning, on average this 30W speaker only uses about 5W of continuous power, and closer to 10W continuous at close to max volume.Conclusion:The sound quality was nearing the jbl xtreme 3, and volume wise the boom was actually louder, at nearly 1/3rd the price, and I was able to make the boom less sharp sounding than the xtreme thanks to the built in eq of the app, as well as adjust my sound for different music styles, and save the presets, something jbl doesn't offer in their app.The cheaper price also is less of a loss in case stolen or broken, and the battery life of the boom was better, sounding better in the higher frequencies when playing back lower bitrate (<144kbits) of mp3 files.The boom like most Bluetooth speakers, doesn't play compressed audio natively, so you'll need an intelligent device, like a phone or laptop to hear any sound.","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2023",AHRXQBON4ZKFMHICQLXN7SIASVKA,True,82,Color: Black

R3639CBRGN74UX,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars #Worthit - A loooong review for dual Boom setup vs Trance Go,DAUN,5,"I finally got both my BOOMS and my TRANCE GO speakers in the mail today and got a chance to hook everything up. This response is super loooooong but, for people like us I think it's worth the read. In short - the BOOMS for the win!! ""Pound for Pound World Champion"" slams again! The Trance Go DOES have more bass.... but not that much really. Honestly I hoped they had more bass for the size & I'm surprised it didn't. It's QUITE a bit heavier than the BOOM for sure. I think taking this out to the park or beach would be much easier with the BOOM. The mids and the highs are louder on the GO but they do sound pretty harsh on my ears. Even with a custom EQ setting. None of us could hang at max inside. Too shrill. My gf and my roommate also said the GO was annoying at high volume but the BOOM sounded really clean and not too ear stabbing at max volume. Both of these tests were using dual speakers. 2 Booms or 2 Go's. Inside both these sound good (favoring the booms) outside the GO's were louder and did have more kick. Mostly mid kick. Honestly I wouldn't say these are party proof for serious party wolves. They can get the job done but compared to my friends Onyx 4 they dont hold up. But I ruled the Onyx series out because of the poor battery, no IPX, and its massive in a backpack. The nice thing about the booms is that you can have 1 person put one in their backpack and someone takes the other to split the load. I do wish that the Boom had a removable handle for easy storage (not my favorite design) I LOVE the handle on the go. It's suuper nice. Oh yeah I got both to play using the TWS or the party cast OR dual audio using the bluetooth feature on my phone. All of them work great. I did have trouble with the directions with the Party Cast with the Go's because the directions SUCK. The Youtube video says to do it one way but it doesn't work! The light doesnt turn blue and it doesnt tell you to double press the button after it blinks. The paper instructions don't tell you to double press either! I had to go to the webpage and read the instructions and do it that way. But it still wasn't correct either. They should really streamline their info. I talked with ANKER and they said you can fill out a forum on their site and a designated team will review all the comments and make changes if they see a need to. So I feel with picky people like us, we can do that and hopefully with the new ""Mega Boom Rave mini Pro 3 Plus Neo Upgraded version 3.2"" they should get it right. :/ There is a micro latency on (with all speakers) videos where you are watching someone's lips. But not too bad. After a while you get over it. I did some 3D spatial audio tests and the booms worked but not the GOs. IDK why? Oh yeah - and one other fun fact is that you can connect the Soundcore Liberty Pro 3 (maybe 2 also?) to the same track that is playing on the speakers! So right now my gf is in the kitchen listening to the same mix as me in the office. Thats handy! Hope this review helps you and others also!

R1A5XXKABN3JTA,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars Versus Boom+,Esot Eric,5,"Got this and the Motion+ at the same time as I could not decide which was right for me based on reviews. Watched a bunch of videos, but still wasn't sure.Hopefully I can make this simple for those in the same boat, the Motion+ audio quality in the highs is definitely better, however lacks bass. So a very load and clear iPhone/iPad style sound which you don't feel as there isn't real bass. If you are using it for movies/podcasts/audiobooks or anything that is primarily speaking and you want to hear what they are saying, get the Plus.If you are listening to music (especially any electronic/hip hop) then the Boom gives you that feeling from the bass that you want. While using the Plus I would never find myself jamming out, it was more of an audiophile experience trying to hear all the higher notes really clear. When I would play the same song on the Boom though, I would jam out and it feels like a lower quality version of my studio monitors.For me being able to bring this camping/boating and jamming out is something I wanted to be able to do, even though listening to podcasts is probably the primary use. The Boom sounds fine with podcasts (not as good as the Plus), but gives you a boombox style sound for music that the Plus can't get close to. And the second you go outside with these speakers, the Plus falls on its face whereas the Boom is thumping and carrying that sound.In the end I went with the Boom because it seemed more well rounded, the plus really feels like it is made for a specific purpose and I don't fit that purpose. If in doubt I would recommend the Boom to anyone, and only if you think it sounds bad, then give the Plus a shot, but for the majority I think they will prefer the Boom. And don't forget you can set custom EQs on these through the app, do some youtube searches and try out some custom EQs, that is what really made the Boom the easy choice for me.So for the Boom itself, build quality is good, this is my 3rd Soundcore/Anker speaker and they are all very durable and well made. The top handle is really sturdy and a great big handle, doesn't feel like I need to be gentle with it which is a plus as I like to travel with it, and knowing it is waterproof is a relief when in the woods. Battery life is ridiculous, I believe their 24 hour claims, typically I use mine for 1.5 hours when I shower/get ready and I have used it weeks without charging. Not sure I will ever be in the situation to fully test the battery, a full weekend of camping was no problem at all. Also love the Bass Boost button on the device so it's not reliant on the app, for podcasts I turn it off and then when I listen to music I turn it on and it works really well with the EQ setup I like.Only downside is hard to call a downside, but that would be size. If you want bigger sound you need a bigger device, so can't knock it for being big. Just be aware of this depending on your uses, if you plan on having it more stationary make sure it will fit.","Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2022",AHA7WK2SN76CQDHCUKZP3IJMN34A,True,10,Color: Black
R164ZQBKGNXY2V,B08LQNL42Z,4.0 out of 5 stars Actually 4.5 stars because nothing is perfect.....but,Mossydog,4,"Great speaker-s, good base, crisp highs, good midrange, works well in a home theater setting, and the background noise or theme music doesn't obscure the actors speaking. It also comes with an app that includes a graphic equalizer, so you can customize the sound to fit whatever space you are in at the moment.The sound quality when listening to music is good by itself, but it really shines when you pair with another Soundcore speaker. I just got my second one and the stereo quality is as good as any I've ever heard. I'm a bit of an audiophile and have owned a lot of good quality stereo and quadrophonic equipment. I also build computers and it sounds as good, or close enough to, any home entertainment system I've ever built It can be a bit tricky to pair and the app won't install on my chromebook (I exist on small portable devices like tablets, TV's, phones and the like, having ditched the Microsoft world years ago) but it does on Android phones, so no worries there, and once you figure out how your speakers pair....there are a couple of ways I've found and it is different on different devices, so I won't go into it here, but it's not difficult no matter what.I tend to charge my speakers after each use, but I haven't run either of them out of charge yet and I sometimes use them all day and on TV at night, so they last basically forever.I bought both of mine on sale, so for a total of 120 bucks, I don't know that there is any better portable music or theater sound system out there, and I've checked, so in my mind this is a an excellent value and one that I will recommend to friends and colleagues. All things considered, A solid high quality choice and a good value, one I'm comfortable recommending.","Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2024",AEP3XUFZU2L2Q6IXDYGY2RNEVNLQ,True,4,Color: Black

I previously had the Bose soundflex but it didn’t have enough bass for me (while the sound quality was insane, I love bass and wanted more). I thought I might be sacrificing sound quality for bass by switching from the Soundflex to the Motion Boom but I can’t say I really have lost any sound quality but rather actually gained some. I also considered getting a JBL speaker but I wanted something that really packed a punch with bass and risked this one. Insane what you get for the price.Unless you are planning on spending a lot of money, I would definitely recommend this one.The handle makes it super portable. Not very heavy.The battery life is as advertised.The customizable eq is what makes this sound really good. Out of the box it is decent, but I would try these following settings to get insane bass without sacrificing sound quality:Hertz: Slider80 +8150. +4300. -1600. -21.2k. +12.5k. +25k. +69k. +613k. +1This can all be done with the soundcore app. The hertz is on the x axis of the equalizer and the +/- is the adjustable line in regards to the y axis.I always listen with the bass boost on.

Stunning battery life, able to charge a phone in a pinch, sound quality is really good.First off, some audiophile freaks are saying that it's not ""that"" good. Look genius, these have 2.75"" speakers. If you expected more than what you're getting, you need to read less snake oil and learn more physics. I rate sound quality 1-4. Passable alone, passable in a loud place, enjoyable at home a room away, and makes-your-hairs-stand-up. This is a 3/4 on this scale which is surprising given the size of these speakers. This is what the ""nicer"" PC speakers were 20 years ago. They've come a long way...Next, I hear from other people that this should float rightside-up while in a pool or river. I agree. And I don't doubt the truth of what they say, it just never occurred to me to expect electronics to function in water unless explicitly advertised as such. This isn't advertised as a floating device, it just has a nice waterproof rating. Those are different things.Next, people say you need to download the app to get decent sound out of it. If you don't like the sound, this is true. But if your mother is over 70 years old and her hearing is going and she just wants to be able to hear music better, then the app isn't needed. I have it. I use it. I appreciate it. I even move the speaker around my rooms to make it sound better. But even I don't really need to app that much. It saves the settings, so you really only need to use the app once, if that.Next, the volume buttons really should be illuminated. I agree with the people saying that. And a pause/play button would be nice. Other than that, it's a phenomenal value for the price.","Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2023",AG4SJ5JBYXGL42GRWTRAHQMV54MQ,True,16,Color: Black
RWNAWY8OHYJA,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars I like it!,DJ EJ ones,5,"Edit: I did a little custom paint job with my Motion Boom. It involves delicately removing the 2 side pieces. Removing the speaker grill. Separating it from the plastic. Sanding down the black paint. And spraying it with your prefered color. Which brings to mind the one thing that this speaker could be lacking is different color choice options. Anyways here is an idea. If you attempt I recommend to turn it off first, be gentle, take your time, and start removing the 2 side pieces in the back in case you make any scratches you won't have to see them from the front.Great portable bluetooth speaker. Looks cute, has a useful handle, charges via USB C, and can charge your phone (at a crawl, but enough for an emergency) through the USB A port. The sound is good, and even better after you adjust the EQ to your preference.I advise that you download the Soundcore app to your phone to adjust the EQ and to quickly update the firmware.Also a quick perusal of the quick start guide is advised so that you know what's what with your speaker and so that you don't complain about not being able to skip songs via the speaker in your review like another review did (to do that you just double press the Soundcore play/pause button).It's a fun device that should satisy almost anyone who uses it correctly (again update the firmware and set the EQ to your liking). You can also use it in concert with another device of the same model, the device has a dedicated button for that function to make it easy. Haven't used that yet but from what I've read it sounds even better and louder than one alone.I remember reading a review complaining about the battery life. That has not been my experience. Battery life is more than adequate. I think this person may have recieved a lemon. These things happen. In these types of cases you should exchange it if you still can through Amazon. If not contact Souncore as the device comes with an 18 month warranty. I myself got the speaker on sale and the 3 year warranty was only $10 so I got that for added peace of mind. But with the water proof/resistance rating and the very solid build I don't anticipate needing to utilize the warranty.Overall, very pleased with my purchase. If you want something that gets even louder, sounds even better, and has dust/dirt protection in addition to watter resistance than I advise you to get the Motion Boom Plus. That one is more expensive and not quite as easily portable but that will be the correct choice for some folks.Best of luck to you and have fun with your speaker. And be mindful of neighbors.

R1B7JZIMRSYHCR,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Speaker I Have Ever Used,Randy Neves,5,"After searching for a bit I decided to give Soundcore a shot, and I am blown away with the quality that I got for 90$. I have owned UE, Bose, Beats, JBL and several other brands, and the only brand I can say comes close is UE, but for 90$ you can buy a speaker that competes with these high end brands at a cost of a 1/3 of them, and get something that although is a plastic body, is durable, water proof with the ability to float. This speaker has good weight to it, lighter than what I was anticipating, and in a good way. The implemented handle is something I love and makes carrying it distances much easier than having to hold it in both hands or get a carry on case. As well as having a battery life that can last 24 hours, this speaker outshine majority of the competition out there.The speaker has several buttons on it, such as volume up/down, with the pause button in the middle using the Soundcore app logo, which I didn't know when I first got it, but upon finding out thought it was a nice touch. There is also a Bluetooth pairing button, as well as a ""party mode"" button labeled TWS which allows users who own multiple Soundcore speakers to pair up to 100 speakers together! (This is something I will test in the future, and will be sure to edit this review if I remember lol) And finally there is a BASS button which can enable/disable bass, which IMO is a brilliant feature just for having that functionality available. (it is recommended to keep bass on for it makes the sound quality much better, but it is nice to have that dedicated button)As for sound quality, out of the box it is okay, the highs are decent, but what separates this speaker from other brands is the app. The app is extremely well made, with the ability to having custom EQ settings with some presets that can help those who are not experienced with toggling EQ settings. Another feature I love is that Soundcore works LUM who is the streaming partner of Soundcore. With LUM you have access to smaller less known artists, and I love the idea of not only being able to find new artist, but for those who don't have a music subscription like Spotify, or Amazon Music, Soundcore can allow users a way to stream music all for FREE! My only gripe with the app is the inability to change tracks if you are using a different streaming app, but its a very minor issue, than doesn't change my opinion on this app and speaker.Overall this speaker is worth the money, and I recommend this to anyone who wants another option from these bigger companies that tend to focus on marketing instead of making good speakers. I love this speaker and will be sure to buy more Soundcore products in the near future!","Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2021",AFW4OEVJATBFASN4BJGYRC6IY6CA,True,0,Color: Black
R3R8KR5JEIQM4F,B08LQNL42Z,"5.0 out of 5 stars Look no further, just get it. (Update) So nice, I bought it thrice.",Just Me,5,"Quick story. I purchased two Harmon Kardon Go + Play Speakers for my wife. One for my wife's home yoga studio where she teaches and one for her home massage therapy room where she performs licensed massage therapy on her clients. I got them both on sale for 180 each which IMO was a steal. (HK msrp of 400 is insanely inflated, but I would pay up to 220 for these guys)My wife also performs licensed massage therapy at a spa with another owner and teaches yoga once a week at an outside gym. I did not want the HK go+play speakers to travel so I started researching budget speakers on YT. I first tried the Bugani M90 which comes in around $50. It wasn't a terrible speaker, had presence and was sparkly, but the lows/bass imo were completely lacking compared to the reviews. It went back. I then went back and forth on the motion boom and the motion plus. I'm no audiophile, but again, IMO the boom just has that warmth and presence from the bass that the motion plus lacks. It just warms up the room. And with the eq mode app from Soundcore, you can fine tune it to get really really close to the motion plus clarity but still gain the low end bass.Alot are excited that Anker crammed five speakers in the plus, but I would almost be willing to bet in a blind test and listen, if the listener had no visuals and never saw these speakers and heard them playing side by side they would probably go with the boom cause it's a room filler, has low end and just sounds all around fantastic.Looks - honestly the boom is a little ugly and cheap looking with the plasticy body and fugly handle.....But, don't judge a book by its cover. This ugly guy sings.So, the boom is going to go back and forth between my wife's away location at the spa and location at the gym because it pumps enough where she can use it at the gym when teaching. Ambient music used during yoga seems to use a lot of low end frequencies for meditation.Also, Im not losing HK go play money on a speaker if someone takes it. Is the boom as good as her HK go play? Nope. Is it good enough that it can still get the job done at half what I paid for the go play and still bring a smile to my face. Absolutely. For less than a large bill, look no further. The boom is a mini bumper that sounds amazing. Awesome job, Soundcore. Update. Loved this thing so much I purchased another to go back and forth from garage to pool.Update again: Purchased another. Taking the garage/pool one (2nd) and the third one on the stand up paddle boards and linking them up when on the lake with my wife.Also, pairing two of these together puts these speakers in beast mode. Sound linked up together fantastic. If you can, try to catch them on sale when they are 75-80 each. Unbeatable.","Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2021",AGT6C2Q5EXBXLONWA6ZGOSUGSQBA,True,147,Color: Black

RJA4EU91P465K,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars I REALLY TOP NOTCH QUALITY AND VOLUME SPEAKER,DTR6484,5,Yes indeed! I was on the fence with this purchase; and I was thinking about spending twice the cost for a better guarantee of loud clean Bluetooth speaker action. I grew up before the EarPods and earbuds current era that makes great sense. But my old school self doesn’t feel right unless I have some blowback from the speakers playing. We had near concert custom made mega speakers and the best vinyl tech possible. The volume was how we escaped into a world of personal intake of the 70’s——So I have had many good Bluetooth speakers that have worked well but still I have been often bummed by the volume if not the integrity of the music when playing from a equalizer from the App Store. Now especially with the lyrics available on Apple Music… it just was a focus upon the EarPods that kept the speakers from working the way this one does. With the brilliance of such EarPods as Jabra and the inclusion of an equalizer specific to the EarPods… things are getting it right and not depending upon third party apps for the boost in bass and sound. This is a great selection for the current selections of awesome new Bluetooth speakers. I have been an Anker fan since I first bought a very small electicity Bluetooth speaker that blew my larger speaker away. Anker either designed this first version of the many too come circular 360 º small speakers that are still excellent. But this is next level for a reasonable price. Less than $100 delivered isabout what I have paid for several name brands that were good but not like this good. The app that you can download is really simple and nothing to worry about having to mess with and go through the pain of exact or weird settings. The basic equalizer setting is perfect. The sound is crisp and loud enough. It still isn’t close to the 7 feet tall speakers of ‘72… but the ability to just play your music from the Apple app makes this very nice. I am betting that the Sonos and the new Sony and JBL all crank massive great volume and texture. But I would not worry about paying an extra chunk of $$ unless you are a total OCD music person who has no limits. My brother is like that and he doesn’t even shop for the Sam reason that he goes to the brand new and continues upgrading. But even though I spend a considerable amount on new products that are? This time I really feel that this was a great deal and bravo to Anker. They just keep getting better and stay affordable.,"Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2021",AF7T7ZHBGF24JVDBTF6T73MTLY3Q,True,0,Color: Black
R2EEB94JSH5H0R,B08LQNL42Z,5.0 out of 5 stars Solid built speaker with good sound,Ellie84,5,"I bought this to replace the soundbar sitting on my workspace desk. I needed something portable that I could also use when I go camping with the kids. This fit the bill and the price was on point. The sound quality is better than I expected and the fact that you can have multiple units synchronized is even better.The overall feel of the speaker is hard plastic with a mesh cover over the front of the speaker, but this doesn't detract from the quality of the item. I haven't tested the waterproof rating so cant speak to that but I am presuming that the hard plastic feel is due to the waterproofing.As far as sound quality goes this is a 30w system and pushes a decent bass feel. I tried different genres of music and the best quality came in on pop/rnb/dance with rock a close second place. It does get a little scratchy on the treble at higher volumes but if you're not planning on max volume you should be fine.Easy to setup and no issues out of the box. In my opinion for the price I paid I could not have received a better sounding bluetooth speaker.","Reviewed in the United States January 17, 2024",AHKQCIY3XMIU6YXHX3QLPF73NAMA,True,1,Color: Black

The bass, treble and mids are all relatively good for a high quality sound system. I'm not an audiophile, so the sound quality is good enough for me. My only gripe is that it doesn't have a headphone jack, which surprised me seeing as phones these days that have a headphone jack do very well with liquid submersion, and could've easily been added as one of the ports behind the rubber door in the back with the USB ports. That way, the port is still protected from liquid and dust anyway. There's also no mention of the fact that this speaker doesn't have a headphone jack, which would've been nice to know before I bought it. Also, as another reviewer here mentioned, I, too find it weird that there's no backlighting for the play/pause button as well as the volume up and down buttons, which definitely makes adjusting the volume a bit cumbersome.","Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2023",AHWXXOQJTMJQCL57GMS7X4KKHAHA,True,1,Color: Black

R3I2T6V2W1CS3N,B08LQNL42Z,4.0 out of 5 stars Really great sound for the price. A couple of things kept me from giving it five stars though.,Kindle Customer,4,"I’ve had this for three months now, and here are my thoughts.First off, this sounds amazing! I love Anker products. I have used their keyboards, charging cables, wall chargers, and headphones. I’ve had my, Anker Soundcore Life 2 Neo headphones, for almost three years now. I’m pretty picky about sound quality, but also on a bit of a budget. Back in 2020, my husband got me the headphones, which I thought I would keep for a few months, and replace with something better. Three years later, and I’m still happy with them, so I thought, i’ve been happy with all of my other purchases from this company, especially my headphones, this has great reviews, so why not take a chance on this speaker? Oh. It was on sale too! That also helped me decide.Last week was the Super Bowl, and my husband and I listened to the game on the speaker. It sounded great! I listen to a wide variety of music, and so far, this speaker has performed pretty well. I’m also surprised at how long the battery lasts in this thing.Now, here are a couple of things that I don’t like about this speaker. First of all, unlike with the headphones that I have, where you can skip backwards and forwards through the tracks, you’re not able to do this with the speaker. That’s kind of inconvenient if my phone is in a different room, and I’d like to skip a track or something.The only other complaint that I have about this speaker is, I wish that it was easier to adjust the sound, and the equalizer.I wish that there were buttons to do it on the speakers, or Sliders that were easier to use with voiceover through the app. I am totally blind, and if you don’t like the presets, it’s kind of hard to get it adjusted just right.Thanks to the reviewer who posted a diagram of how it should be adjusted for optimum sound, my husband, who is cited, was able to do it for me through the app.Overall, I am very pleased with this speaker. I’m glad I didn’t waste big money on a Bose. My daughter has one, and I think this little speaker sounds better than her way more expensive one.","Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2023",AEYIVZMSSWUGEELX53QPMIQGNXSA,True,19,Color: Black

HOWEVER For the price this is an extreme value and in a lot of instances ""good enough"". I find in bluetooth speakers I'm normally hoping for either more clarity, more volume, or more bass.So indoors the volume on this thing far exceeds your needs. I like it loud and I am not shy about turning up the volume. I can say inside this thing has more volume and I wouldn't turn it up all the way. Part of the reason is it starts to distort some, not horrible but it's there.When being used at 75% volume which is plenty loud it maintains clarity and its loud everything below 75% is very nice. Highs lows and mids are present and accounted for.The bass... I can say it does have a nice meaty bottom end to it, but.... It's nice bass for two passive radiators, and two 3 inch drivers or whatever they are. Meaning it won't and can't compare to my home theater setup with a 15"" sub. I don't want to dismiss this though because as I say I'm normally always wanting more bottom end. And while it sounds like deep mids and they are a little muddy hey... They are there!The thing kind of has a cheap feel to it, but hey man the price reflects this. They have put their money where it counts which is in the hardware itself. While it feels cheap it's perfectly functional and has a usable feel. Meaning scratch the outside... Meh. I don't care. Drop it and would it shatter or crack... Maybe but I doubt it.I've been trying everything I can think of for the ultimate speaker that is still reasonably portable but still puts it out. I own a Minirig 2.1 setup and that is the gold standard, however it's fiddly to setup and cart around. I've auditioned a Marshall Tufton, and Stockwell, most of the Jbl lineup, Bose, and all of them have failed in some area or another. The Tufton was great but at 11 pounds it just isn't realistic to cart around. I'm just looking for something I can grab and take it to the pool and not worry about it, be able to jam all day, and it doesn't leave me wanting for sound... I know pretty much just perfection. This speaker may very well be the one. It's not perfect but for a grab and go and at the price it is 100% impossible to fault this thing.

I have owned many portable Bluetooth speakers over the years that I have spent upwards of $500 for There are so many options available on Amazon. I bought five different speakers ranging from $50-$100. This Anker speaker with integrated handle was tops ! If you download their app, you can customize the equalizer sound for the type of music you’re listening to. Which made the speaker sound so much better than out of the box. None of the other speakers had this option. Many of the other speakers Highlighted dancing lights, multi directional sound, and the ability to hook up multiple speakers for party mode. Although that sounds great, I need one good mobile speaker that I could take to the park, to the patio, and even to the beach. This speaker has great sound and amazing power for the size. The speaker was far superior to the others— I don’t want to slam other brand names but some of them were by name most of us have heard of. . This speaker is IPX7 waterproof, not splash resistant…it has a charging port to charge your phone if you’re running low on juice, and it has great customizable sound. The other speakers sounded good. But the high end sounded flat on almost all of them, Especially if there was any bass sound present. . This speaker is truly a great value for the price point!

R29HXOVZ9UQV81,B08LQNL42Z,4.0 out of 5 stars enough BOOM for the buck,jim,4,"To me Anker is synonymous with quality, reliability and value...kinda like a honda. I never feel ripped off buying Anker products.You're looking at this item for the bass and if you've used any of Anker's Soundcore products, you know that they use the passive radiator to great effect and create bass out of 'thin air'! The Motion Boom delivers and even in an outdoor setting, it creates enough bass that even at a pool party for 28 fourteen year olds, there was enough audio entertainment and 'boom' up to 5 yards away. You're not going to 'feel' it from there but it's loud. Subjectively, I'd say you can feel the bass up to 3 yards if your standing in the right places. Indoors is same but you can feel it everywhere.Batterylife is 'so-so'; at ~80% max volume for 4 hours battery went from 100% -> 50%. I was expecting a lot more.Bluetooth connectivity was great, I was wandering around 20-30 yards away and signal/sound never dropped.Sound quality is ok...this one is about going loud and boomy while still delivering solid mids and highs, and to do that you're going to have to use the custom settings in the app. fyi: that bass button isn't as effective as a custom profile. I don't have a Motion+, nor have I ever heard one but I'll take it on review that the audio quality is better over the Motion Boom and I took it on review that the Boom was better for outdoors...and I'm happy with my choice.Build quality; as you expect with all things Anker is very good. Everything feels solid.Warranty: if you've ever had to deal with Anker customer service you know it's awesome!Results: 4 stars. I kinda reserve 5 stars if you can compare to competitor products at 2x-3x the price (in this case JBL Boombox2 or PartyBox100), so my apologies to those of you who think this deserves 5.

It has performed admirably, and the battery still lasts many hours. I generally am listening to podcasts or quiet music while working- in that scenario, I can go many workdays before charging it. We have also used it for parties, playing music pretty loudly, and it easily lasts five hours or more. When me or my kids feel like blasting some music, it still works great and the sound is fantastic.In August 2023, we had a large party at our clubhouse, and I thought the one unit alone might not quite cut it. So, I bought a second and paired them... and was blown away, pretty much literally. Together, the volume, base, clarity and stereo sound is vastly improved from the already great single unit. We placed them on each side of a ~30X25 foot room filled with lots of people, and the sound was fantastic, especially after I altered the equalizer on the app. The pair lasted about 5 hours at very high volume playing bass-heavy songs, and still looked to have a good amount of battery left according to the app.I just can't speak highly enough of these units- the sound they produce out of such small, high quality package is incredible.","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2023",AGVGSDZHQIWJLKWSX2SGGSJX5QTQ,True,11,Color: Black

R1PLAYSCV96DGD,B08LQNL42Z,4.0 out of 5 stars Lots of bass,DeJay,4,"Most reviews say how loud the Motion Boom is but that means different things to different people. To me loud means I can barely hear the guy next to me. These have a good volume and in a closed room they seem louder but you can still talk over the music. You will need the Soundcore app to access the EQ as the base can drown out other parts of the music. I listen to harder rock music and it felt like the drums were drowned out. Even with the EQ I still can't get it just right. My wife listens to other types of music and she likes the sound.The battery life is good so far. You should fully charge it before using however it doesn't come with a charger. They recommend a charger that supplies 5 volts and 2 amps. I checked the ones I had and found I needed to purchase a new one. I really think they should include a charger.The app tries to make you think you need an account to use it but you don't. I don't like the fact that just because I need to use an equalizer, Soundcore needs my personal information. I would review the app separately but you'll need it and as far as I'm concerned, That makes it part of the product. An SD card slot would be nice and you could remove the microphone as I would never use this as a hands free device.It's louder than most speakers it's size (I haven't heard them all) and sounds better at a louder volume than most. I purchased it on sale and despite it's short comings, I still feel it was well worth the 80.00 I paid for it. I may purchase a second one at the regular price to use the stereo pairing feature.","Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2022",AETXSF5UAHE4XQSF3OTQVAIEET4A,True,7,Color: Black

Without using the tunable EQ, they have perfect bass. From Death Metal, to progressive to Jazz. However... With my usual UK Drum And Bass, I pumped the EQ curve up to a V curve, and they blew me away! All types of EDM benifited from this. From Portishead, to House, Breaks, Trap, all the way to Jump Up and Liquid. AND NO DISTORTION! I'm sold. I haven't had this response without a headphone amplifier on any other pair. So, without the EQ change, they were a bit bassier than some more analitical cans. That can be dialed back. After which they sort of feel like Bayerdynamics. But pump up the bass, and strap in! I'm going to buy a higher end set soon. I'll review them too. Hope this helps anyone that listens to EDM or any other Bass heavy music, but still wants great battery life.

RN32E5AT8VJTJ,B072NY334R,"3.0 out of 5 stars Crisp clear sound -- I'll give you that -- but could use a little more oomph, and not the best value.",jimmy the greek,3,"The headphones are great so far -- a little quieter than my previous V-Moda LP Crossfade and definitely don't have as much kick as they do but they are very stylish and comfortable compared to the Crossfades which in comparison almost feel like wearing an anchor on your head. Plus they are wireless.One thing that did rub the wrong way was the fact that these nice, polished, stylish pair of headphones from a well known brand with a hefty price tag did not come with any sort of case. My previous two pairs of headphones (Sony Noise Cancelling, and V-Modas) both came with nice cases. I know it probably sounds like I am whining or complaining, but I mean really c'mon! They are that expensive, and you brag about the quality, and you can't even include a simple case?Overall,Sound quality -- 4 -- crisp and clear, but a little light and doesn't kick as hard as other headphones such as the V-Modas, I realize this is preference, but for me, I like a nice kicking headphone.Sound deadening -- 4 -- they do a good job of isolating noise.Style -- 5 -- This is their shining feature. They are very stylish.Comfort -- 5 -- Again, another one of their strong points.Value -- 3 -- This is probably their weakest categories. The V-Modas in comparison are a steal, and they come with a nice hardshell case and two extra aux cables but they are lighter and more stylish.Would like to give a 3.5 but can't so just purely on the fact that I wouldn't actually recommend these over the V-Modas I went with a 3.

I loved that I could use them wired or wireless. Battery life is very good. Look great.Downsides:nit picky, but the buttons are a bit challenging to use when you are wearing the phones, but they work as designed.The big downside - my left channel died exactly 2 years after purchase. I've contacted B&O support, but have not heard back, and seeing other reviews on this page, don't expect a positive response. At this price point, I expected exceptional reliability. I wear these only at home and gently. After two years they don't show any significant wear and tear. I think the wire may have gotten loose - jiggling the left cup would bring the single back, but that only worked for two days.If I get a good response from B&O I'll update this review, and my rating, but otherwise be wary before purchasing that these might not last for the long haul - something that really surprised me for this brand. If they do last, they are a great set of cans.June 2021 updateKnocking off another *. I really wanted to give these a 4 star review, but for issues noted above, I couldn't. I don't expect headphones will last forever, but at this price point (higher when purchased than now) I would expect them to last more than 2-3 years. I've completely lost the left channel now and there really seems to be no way to repair these myself and attempts at finding a third party to repair them have come up blank as well. I was expecting to get another pair of B&O (H9 or HX?) in a couple more years, but at this point I'll be looking elsewhere.To re-iterate. Look great, feel great, sound great! If you don't mind the fact that they just might not last more a few years at this price point, then they are good.

The detail of the sound is also sometimes jarring and in some cases distracting. I feel like I can tell how the mics were arranged about the drum kit, but I have to really try to hear the bass. This probably reflects the intent of the recording better than the skull candy headphones I replaced with these, but those cheaper headphones sounded warmer and fuller and I didn’t feel like I was missing anything, even if I really was.The buttons are solid and tactile, that’s nice, but it took several tries to figure out how to turn the damn things off. I can’t turn them off without activating Siri. How dumb is that? And it’s not like I can ask Siri to turn them off, she’s just waiting for me to ask something when the headphones finally turn off. Turning them on always feels speculative too.They do very little to shut out outside noise. I don’t need noise canceling. My skull candy’s didn’t have any noise cancelling and I couldn’t hear a damn thing with them on.The instructions imply you need to install some app. I did that. The app did nothing at all and further told me I needed a different app. There ought to be a law against hardware/device makers lying about needing to install software to use a device.They DO appear to be pretty solidly put together. This is why I had to replace my skull candy’s (never buy skull candy’s, they’re made of the cheapest, most brittle plastic).If someone could point me to a different brand that is both solidly built and tuned for more warmth and bass, I’d return these H4’s in a second.EDIT after more than a year of use:1. The mobile app has an equalizer, and the settings appear to persist when I switch to my work laptop, and now I’ve got the bass and warmth back I was missing.2. The battery only lasts half as long as advertised. It’ll only charge to %80, and then it starts beeping about low battery at %30.

Only giving four stars because for some reason every once in awhile the sound drops out while I'm listening. The battery will be fine, the bluetooth connection will be fine, and the volume on my phone will be the same, but the volume setting on the headset inexplicably and steadily drops down to zero (doesn't just cut out abruptly). It's not terrible, and it hasn't been a huge issue - only happened once or twice - but weird quirk I guess?Also, these are not noise canceling. I prefer it that way since I mainly use these while walking around the city and I want to be able to keep an ear out for traffic and such, but while they dull the noise you shouldn't count on these to give you a silent rest on the airplane or anything like that.","Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2018",AGAESUYNAEQ5ANQ3SHRWXTHR5XXA,True,6,Color: Gray

RE26ONDQ7LVY2,B08WH43KXR,"4.0 out of 5 stars Battery Can Last, But Not Much ANC",Audrey Meyer,4,"TL;DR: The Everyday Wireless BT Over Ear Headphones are a solid 4/5 at this price. They could have been a 5/5 if not for the fit and the low ANC. If you want a 5/5 and don't mind the price difference, the Pros are a big upgrade. Raycon really stands by their products and are determined to ensure you get genuinely good quality headphones.Update (Feb 28, 2024): (4/5 stars) I needed to come back to make this update (a) to tell y'all how great Raycon's customer service is and (b) address the fact that I was being dramatic. The Everyday Wireless BT Over Ear headphones are mid, but they're priced mid, and the expectation is that they'll be mid. The sound quality is good and they're light weight. The biggest issue for me is still the size - they're just too big for my head. But, all things considered, the only thing these headphones don't do great is ANC. They could dim noise, but not really cancel.In comes Raycon's customer service. I had purchased the Over Ear headphones a couple weeks before the Pros came out. Even though it was past my return window, they let me exchange the normal Everydays for the Pros and there is a world of difference. (There's also a pretty big price difference, so the Pros really should be that much better.) The Pros fixed 99.9% of my issues with the Over Ears. If you're not worried about budget, upgrade to the Pros. If you're looking for good headphones on a budget, the regular Everyday Over Ear Headphones are genuinely a #good pair of headphones. They're lightweight, cute, the sound quality is good, and they hold a charge for DAYS. I gave 3/5 stars in my original review because I was expecting the Pros from a product that was wasn't designed or marketed to be the Pros.--Original (Feb 2, 2024): (3/5 stars) This might be specific to head shape, but the comfort and noise cancelling of these headphones just weren't there for me. They constantly feel a little bit too big and I don't get a good cover over my ears. The band over the head isn't adjustable either.The setting with the ANC on and with ANC off sound exactly the same to me. The setting for awareness noise just feels loud. I hear less of what I'm trying to listen to and So Much More of the noise around me. On any of the settings, all sound seems very one-level. Nothing particularly extraordinary. As someone who listens to a lot of ASMR, I want more depth.Battery lasts for a good while before you have to charge, at least.","Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2024",AE3JWSP33J5HSZFKHSBVELQCXWDA,True,3,Color: Rose Gold

The noise cancelation feature was highly desired. Music sounded great, she said, but it let too much noise through. I would guess some listeners do NOT want total noise cancelation so they can maintain at least some awareness of their surroundings. My daughter studies on a ""safe"" campus in safe spots in safe buildings - she was ok seating herself where she could see what was coming if she had to, but didn't want to hear people's conversations/music/etc. She ultimately chose more expensive/better headphones with more control over just how much cancelation of ambient noise there would be. Again, she LIKED these headphones for listening to music/lectures, but they just let too much noise through for her preferences. If the noise cancelation was adjustable, she never figured out how to make it work right.

ROEMRXNWUPH7V,B08WH43KXR,4.0 out of 5 stars Great all around for the price,Paul Ratzlaff,4,"I bought these flash sale for $41 versus the list price of 59.99 and compared it to the Raycon every day headphones which listed for 99.99 and I got through Black Friday sale for 69.99 and found the Raycons Had a better feel. The Life Q 20s had to be played with full volume on the phone did not connect automatically to Bluetooth like the Raycon did and they were not water resistant like the Raycons were. The Raycons had a more in-depth base about it and I liked the way the Raycons Told you that it was connected to the Bluetooth when you first put them over your ears. I could feel the sound better with the Raycons. The soundcore, Life Q 20s did not connect automatically and just gave you a series of bleeps to let you know it was connected. So construction wise and convenience wise and sound wise I found the Raycons better. I then compared the Raycons to a pair of beats solo3 which listed for 199 and you can get them at Costco in black for $99 which is what I paid for them in an Amazon cyber Monday sale. The sound quality of the beats solo3 was by comparison Superior to even the Raycons. If you set your phone volume to high, you can still adjust the beats up or down without it affecting the volume on your phone, whereas both the Raycon and the soundcore when you increase or decrease the volume it would increase or decrease it on your phone . I returned this product and spent the little extra money for the beats solo3 and am happy. But if you’re looking for a good sound for under 50 bucks the soundcore life Q20 is very good. For a price between 50 and 100 the Raycon fit the category and was great, and if you’re not afraid to spend the extra bucks, the beats solo3 is the best.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023",AFDUE4P2K26EO2ZHXFVG4TUTJRGQ,True,7,Color: Black

The sound though is excellent, like really top-notch. The base is deep and the treble is high. The absolute only thing I don't like about this headset though, is it doesn't squeeze onto my ears completely. The bottom edge of the pads are hanging off my head, which lets sound in. If I cup my hands on both sides, it encompasses my ears properly, but watching anything like that isn't an option.

R2DUG7ZG6F1Y8S,B08WH43KXR,2.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good! **UPDATED**,Uhlyssa,2,"**UPDATED REVIEW 6/1/24**Okay, it's been a while since I wrote my review and I've picked up on a couple of things that other folks might wanna know. I still stand by the ANC and music quality being awesome, but the following has been driving me nuts:1. The battery life drains significantly faster than it did when I first started using these. They used to last up to 5 days of 8 hour daily use, and now I have to recharged them every couple of days after daily 8 hour use.2. If I'm attending a zoom/google call and use the headphones and mic, the audio quality switches to a ""cellphone"" like quality. Often, the ""cellphone"" static would increase to deafening volumes at random points of the calls. The only way to stop the static would be to turn them off and on again.3. They have a pretty low range. If I walk away from my desk--but stay in the room--the audio stutters.They've served me well for the time that I've had them, but I'm definitely looking for another pair soon.**ORIGINAL REVIEW**Been using mine since December, so I feel like I've got a good idea about how it works for me.I use it for WFH. I have roommates, a dog, and cats that talk a LOT. And my desk is situated in a room with no door--just to lay the scene of what I'm working with lol.Zoom calls - Mic and sound delays a bit. Audio quality also switches to like a ""phone call""-like quality. I typically switch to my gaming headset for calls.Music quality - SO nice for the price. The bass is bumpin, the sound is clear.ANC - Pretty good!! Blocks out the sound of my roommate cooking, the fans in our place, washing machine, etc. It blocks out sounds like that vs. my dog barking, someone watching TV really loud, etc. But if I'm focused enough on work, I hardly notice what my roommate is up to.The only gripes I have:Bluetooth stutter - These headphones stutter the most out of any set I have. It's pretty simple to fix (disconnect, turn off, reconnect again) but can be a bit annoying at times.ANC gets loud out of nowhere/makes static noises - This doesn't happen very often, but enough for me to notice. If i have ANC on, sometimes I'll hear a faint static noise. A couple of times the ANC ends up making ALL the noise and scaring the jeezus out of me. Not all the time, again, but enough for me to notice.Size adjustment - JBL may have just spoiled me, but these headphones don't adjust in terms of fitting on your head. So if you have a bigger head (or, smaller) just be aware of that! They slide a bit on me if I look down for too long, but it's fine.All in all, for the price, I'm SUPER happy with these!! But definitely wanted to warn folks about the couple of issues above if you're considering these.","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024",AGP6VCPUC65OWIA5M6SMMIAOXSQA,True,26,Color: Black

I feel that having the right headphones and earbuds is supposed to enable you to listen to your music in a way you've never heard them before.I am not an audiophile but I have used many headphones/earbuds since I got my first Sony Walkman II in the 1980s. This set captures the highs as well as the lows very well without the superfluous bass that muffles the sound. I never understood why Beats are so popular when the bass keeps the song sounding muffled and the highs are not crisp. I am not comparing these to Sennheiser or Bose (I haven't tried either one) but for the money the Raycons are less than 1/2 the price for any of the aforementioned headphones with pretty decent sound. I'd say it's a win-win.Also the box is thin and very light. I couldn't believe there was a pair of headphones in there but on my head they feel like any other pair of headphones of this size. The only downfall I can see so far is that Raycon doesn't supply a storage case. If they did, it would pretty much be perfection.","Reviewed in the United States September 6, 2023",AF577XYAUH4Q6MHVKP47RDDSW6KQ,True,28,Color: Rose Gold

I don’t really like the active noise cancelling, you can still hear everything around you pretty much, with my AirPods I’m used to everything being tuned out, but I guess that hearing background would be good if I need to hear when I have them on at the airport. The noise quality really isn’t that good. I like to blast my music really loud which is something I appreciated about my old studio beats, these don’t have very good bass nor do they have loud sound. I do like the phone call feature, I can be heard clearly and easily on the phone. For me, I think these headphones are good for people who like background noise while they’re doing other things, so I’ll most likely where these when I go out and want to still be aware of what’s happening. I think though for my night music blasting where I want to drown in my music, I’ll look into studio Beats Pro instead.","Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2024",AHX3T2HO67SUWADHWKPWV3IG5DWA,True,2,Color: Black

This raycon headset has half the battery life (when brand new), poorer sound quality and a white noise can be heard when no sound is playing (even with noise cancelling off). When the headset has low battery, it will grant you with a very loud and annoying (Low battery, please charge !) every 5 minutes but the headset can still work for several hours. I prefered the system that was on my old headset, which would only tell you that the battery is low when turning it on. Now that I had this Raycon headset for a few months, the battery life is divided by 4 and it can't even last a full day. I never unplugged it before it was fully charged and took good care of it so I don't know what is the problem beside it being the quality of a 30 dollar headset. While taking less care of it, my last headset (which was the SAME price) lasted several years and I would still be using it if not for the foam (which can be replaced, can't say the same about Raycon).

I'm a musician and a pilot, so headphones are important to me, and I use them a lot. I bought these for the gym because my good ones get destroyed by sweat. The noise cancelation on them is medium, not great. I wouldn't trust it to block out sound on an airplane (as a passenger). There is no case, but they do fold up. There is no charging cube, only the USB cable. The volume is fine but the quality of sound is subpar. It is pre-EQed. There are too many highs and lows, no mids. interestingly there is ""awareness"" mode which allows you to hear ambient noise from the room (instead of taking off the headphones). They do come with an 1/8"" cable to plug them into old devices. They have buttons which are confusing. The (+) and (-) operate both the volume and the skip track. No touch sensitive controls. These are ok but I'm on the verge of returning these for the poor sound quality.","Reviewed in the United States December 17, 2023",AEY2A4YXRDQK3Z7ZPE56TFSUPSCQ,True,3,Color: Black

RLGDBYQXKLZHL,B083W7V3RG,"3.0 out of 5 stars For me, uncomfortable and awkward",D Porter,3,"Earphones/headphones are a very individual item, what with fit, sound, controls, etc. For me, these were uncomfortable on my ears within minutes and painful after about a half hour. Headphones are usually described as ""over the ear"" or ""on the ear."" I'm 6'1"" and have been accused of having big ears but I think a person would have to be a midget to have these fit over the ear. The 450BT's are, for me anyway, definitely ON the ear. I bought these specifically to watch tv using the aptX feature. But, if they're painful to wear after a half hour, they won't work for that purpose, at least for me. I've used Sony and Bose over the ear 'phones that might cause some ear fatigue after awhile, but nothing like these. Even a cheap pair of Skullcandy phones, (definitely ON the ear), were much more comfortable for me. But, I also read reviews here from people who have no issue with pressure on their ears, so if they work for you or you like on the ear style phones, awesome.Controls are also somewhat awkward and strangely arranged, making them difficult to use while wearing, as other reviewers have also noted. There are lots of similar headphones out there with controls on the sides, *all* of them that I've seen are better than these. Again, even my cheap pair of Skullcandy on-the-ear phones have buttons that are big, easy to use, and almost impossible to have to fumble with - they're great. By contrast, in the short time I was trying these 450BT's, I was constantly having trouble finding the volume button, accidentally pausing or fast-forwarding what I was watching, or turning them off. I'm sure most people would *eventually* get used to the controls, but why design them so you have to?In my short time trying them out, the sound seemed warm, inviting, but a little heavy on the mids and lows, and I had to really crank them louder than I'm used to to hear dialogue. The app that Sennheiser tells you to download would probably work to help adjust these issues and I note that other reviewers praise the sound these deliver, especially after using the in-app EQ.Because of the fit which will does not make it comfortable for me watch even one tv program, coupled with the constant irritation of the poorly designed controls, I'll be returning the 450BT's and happy to be rid of them.","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2023",AFG65WM2YPS44OXUMUNMJEXXO5DQ,True,1,Style: OriginalColor: Black

They also paired well with my Hisense U8G 65"".There are so many great things to say about Seinnheiser in general. It's impossible to knock them on build quality, looks, and sound.The ear cushions on these are made for children. Anyone with larger ears will likely suffer pain. I can make it about 20 minutes before I reach for my Ankbit E600Pro's to give my ears a break. I found some GVOEARS replacement ear cushions that suposedly help with exactly that ear discomfort problem.The on and off functions is badly implemented. To turn on, you have to press the on button for two seconds, but even a fraction of a second more and it goes into pairing mode. To fix, you have to turn if off and back on (more carefully this time). It's supposed to take 4 seconds to flip into pairing mode, but by the time the voice start's to say it's powered on, it's too late. There is a very (very) subtle click that you can listen for to know when to release (any ""Quick and The Dead"" fans here?). What would be great is if the power button turned them on and off instantly, but maybe that's not going to happen with multi-function buttons on a bluetooth device.My daughter shuns these because of what she considers weird button placement. I like the fact that I can find the volume buttons (there's a bump on the + side).I'm knocking one star off for the discomfort and pairing mode pitfall. I know Seinnheisers do break in/loosen (too much sometimes), so if that happens or the replacement earpads fix the discomfort, I'll update the review.","Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2023",AH7LSJMTNS7OFQ4OXZ5O7VTKZXIQ,True,1,Style: Special EditionColor: Black

You have to go into settings and reconnect during the first part of every phone call, and then for some reason they disconnect after 5 minutes exactly.

I do not need to know what my battery level is unless it's low, but these headphones will inform you of the battery level at full charge. To top it all off, even those notifications are useless. It will tell you ""Between 6 and 12 hours remaining"". Why in the world would I need to know that and how can you only know battery life within a 6 hour window.Turning on the headphones has no immediate feedback and the difference between pressing the on button to just turn it on and held to pair is miniscule. You will constantly go into pairing mode when you mean to just turn it on and won't know which you did until you hear ""Pairing..."" a couple of seconds later.

R2VJSWJLV3QHV6,B083W7V3RG,"3.0 out of 5 stars Great Quality, Terrible QOL",Eric,3,"These headphones offer a great sound experience for the price, there's not denying that. The noise cancelling is excellent and the quality of the sound is both extensive and full. If that and the price were all there was to judge about these headphones, they'd have a 5. But, the headphones also are meant to offer several hands-off features and QOL bits which, to put simply, hardly work. The built in ability to pause and skip or rewind, offered through a poorly thought out design of a single toggle that moves, works only about 10 percent of the time. Additionally, the thought process behind this bit of hardware seems not to have been well thought out or tested. To pause, skip, or rewind, the headphones have a plastic bit that can be pushed in, pushed forward, or pushed backward respectively. However I've found that more often than not, when I go to pause the headphones will register it as a skip instead. This could be because I press on the toggle when I go to skip, sure, but even when I'm exceptionally careful about this, I still have issues.Additionally, there is no way to check what the headphone's battery life is at. On my old Sony headphones which were about $50, I could at least hit a button and hear a range of time I had left. With these, you get a warning that you have somewhere between 2-5 hours of battery life left, and that only pops up once in that time span from what I've seen. Very easy to miss if, by chance, you take the headphones off for a minute.What's more, there's a continual issue with these that when they disconnect from something they will continually and constantly alert you to this fact until you turn them off and on again. Yes, I know I disconnected you from my computer. I did that so I could listen to music on my phone, but you keep warning me that you've ""been disconnected."" It's an easy fix of restarting, but I just don't see why this is an issue I should have to deal with.Finally, while the headphones aren't uncomfortable, they certainly do my head and ears no favors if I happen to have them on for more than a few hours. They have a habit of squeezing your ears in, which is painful after a few hours. The headband is adjustable but the fabric used to cushion has a tendency to also be rather grippy, which can cause some strange head fatigue I've found.Compared again to the previous headphones I had for $50, the sound quality is incredible. For that alone I would say if you're in the market for excellent quality headphones for the price, these are probably them. But on almost every other front I would rather have those Sony headphones again.Buy with caution, I would say.","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2023",AEU7LFL65HGNSPCAY4VA2UKSLIRQ,True,7,Style: OriginalColor: Black

But this pair of active noise-canceling headphones is a true letdown! Pros 👍👍👍 - Build: Solid with no creaks or gaps.- Compact: They fold down and pack small.- Comfortable to wear with room for adjustment.- Versatile: they can be used wired & wireless.- Battery Life: up to 30 hours with USB-C fast charging.- It comes with a carry case.- 2-year warranty is commendable.Cons 👎👎👎 - Controls: A bunch of buttons crammed together with no rhyme or reason, no labeling, and no easy way to navigate by touch! 😑- Voice Prompts: It tells you everything, except for the one thing you need the most—it won’t tell when ANC is on or off! It’s infuriating! 😤- Active Noise Canceling (ANC): It makes a difference, but it’s negligible at best!- Audio Tuning: Everything sounds flat and lifeless, with volume bouncing up and down inexplicably! 😳- No Proximity Sensor so they don’t pause when take them off which is real nuisance 😑- SE stands for Special Edition, but I can’t figure out what's so special about them. Seriously, what is it?🤔- The Price You Pay: At $200 MSRP, this set is a hard sell! On sale for $80, it’s still a pass for me! Pay a few bucks more and get a Sony WH-CH720N, or if you’re on a really tight budget, get Anker’s Soundcore Q20 for $40–$60.My Verdict 🧐 I am not here to bash Sennheiser or throw shade at its good name, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this product, especially if you’re planning on using it while traveling. Skip this or suffer buyer’s remorse! You may think I’ve come down hard on Sennheiser in this review, and maybe I did, but those headphones are the worst I’ve ever come across, except for only the Koss KPH7, but those were $20 and made no claims to greatness!I hope my review will help you make a more informed buying decision 👍😊✌️","Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2023",AE27QLIMXYQBTPI3UFZ6V5WZRQ7A,True,4,Style: Special EditionColor: Black
R2HICICMVE0DIH,B083W7V3RG,2.0 out of 5 stars Died in a few months,jrdaley,2,"I bought these due to the attractive price point while still having more modern features than the old headphones I was using. However, I ended up having a number of problems with them:1. The headset was fairly uncomfortable at first. I saw this in reviews and prepared for it, but it still took some time to break them in and get used to how stiff the ear cups were.2. Difficulties with the app. Not only did I have a hard time initially pairing the headphones to the app (they connected to my phone's bluetooth fine, the app just refused to recognize they were connected), but once connected, the app seemed to not have many features to it. Not having the ability to switch between connected devices in the app was especially rough.3. Trouble with powering on. After a few months, the headphones would make a high pitched squealing noise when I tried to turn them on. It would take a few attempts before they would finally power on, before eventually refusing to power on at all until I reset the headphones.4. After 3-4 months of ownership, no sound came out of one ear via bluetooth. I could tell noise cancelling was still working on that side, they just refused to play any audio. Resetting the headphones did not fix this one.After point number 4, I was ready to give up on these, and contacted Sennheiser for a warranty replacement. To my surprise, they sent me back a completely different (better) model instead. So if you're looking at these, I HIGHLY recommend spending a bit more and getting the Accentum Plus model instead. They have solved all the pain points I've outlined above, and have lasted longer than I had the HD 450 BT model for.","Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2024",AEXYC2LRJR5A7UCOS4FW24VQSZPQ,True,0,Style: OriginalColor: Black
R3HBIYDPPDRXTI,B083W7V3RG,3.0 out of 5 stars Worth considering other options,Sam Meyers,3,"I enjoyed music quality and comfort as well as BT5.0 and USB C charging. Battery life is solid and it is easy to pair and use. Some call the controls complicated and though I agree the play/pause button isn't well done, I adjusted in a few days and was mostly fine. I did contact support for help with my issues. None was available.I'm returning this product for the following reasons, in no particular order. I don't recommend you purchase these unless they fall under $100 or you are fine with the issues.1. ANC toggles on and off with the push of a button for a purple indicator light. You get a second or two where the audio drops out while this kicks in. Or maybe off. There is no indication, on the headphones or app, that say ANC is on or off. the light toggles purple either way. You can guess given ambient noise but you'll never know! There is no known fix for this or support had no input.2. ANC seems to kick in for calls with something they call sidetone. It pipes in ambient audio so you can hear yourself and not be too loud. Except, I just hear everything except the call. Call audio drops below ambient noise, even just working in the kitchen or tasks where a speakerphone might cut it. So these are useless to me on calls and I redirect to the headset I am trying to replace. It might as well not have call options at all. No fix or patch coming as far as support has said.3. If you pair this to 2 devices, say your phone and a laptop, you have to be careful to disconnect when you go out of range of 1 device. If you do walk away or go on a walk, you will need to power off the headphones then power them back on and connect to the 1 device (out of range of the other device). Otherwise, you will have a nice British voice say 'Disconnected' every 5 seconds. No, the device does not reconnect when back in range, at least not reliably for me to notice it tried to. There is also no fix for this though it's entirely software...With that in mind, are these a good fit? For about $100 I'd probably keep them but need a second headset of the same type for calls, making them effectively useless if the other set has noise cancelling and decent audio. There may not be better headphones at that price range either, feature wise. I appreciate USB C. The audio cable it comes with works well though may be short for large desk spaces. Battery life is great as I went maybe 4 days straight with extended use before charging, but not because they needed a charge. They are comfortable on my head, though some may find the top band a bit thin.","Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2020",AFMBGDGZMOHY2ZY42WRV2754XYZQ,True,284,Style: OriginalColor: Black

Still not bad quality but you really do notice the difference. Gonna be honest, this is far below the usual Sennheiser product quality. Like.. what was the plan here? Nothing worked out of the box, which is in-line with a lot of the reviews I'm seeing here. My friend has this exact pair and it worked fine for him?? I'm only keeping the rating at 2 stars because it will still run on aux. The return process is a pain for stuff like this so I will hold onto these as a backup set.Off-rip this thing gave me plenty of trouble. The set just wouldn't go into connecting mode, and eventually just stopped turning on entirely. The one saving grace is that it does just work if you use the detachable AUX. I saw a few mixed reviews outside Amazon that mentioned this, but I didn't think it would happen to me. Unfortunately, the built-in mic will only work when connected via bluetooth, or at least that's what my Linux setup restricts me toIf you don't have a standalone mic and are running into this issue, well...Pros:Sound quality is almost top-tier. The only other headsets that sound better, fit worse. If you have ears made of steel, OneOdio has better sound quality. If you turn on noise cancelling you do get slightly better sound and noticeable bass. This does work without actually having to power on the headset (thank goodness).Cons:Quite literally everything else. This is just a more expensive version of my Hyper-X set. Better quality, no mic (again, because no bluetooth, no power-on, etc). And yeah, that means the voice assistant, etc. are a lost cause as well.Overall, I'm disappointed. I've bought different sets from Sennheiser in the past and have had nothing but the best to say about them. I'm sure other people have bought these exact pair and have had better luck.

These headphones have served me through thick and thin and for the price you are paying serve their purpose wonderfully. To start off with the noise cancellation, these headphones are not the best for that, and I feel like there is definitely better products out there if noise cancelling is your primarily goal. I couldn't even say that the noise cancelling is good, if you are in a moderately filled room, they may serve you well enough so you can't clearly make out any words, but you'll still hear stuff. I'm going to void over the noise quality as my experience in this department is really small, but I mean you'll hear stuff, and you'll enjoy your music comfortably. Lastly, and this is single handedly my biggest issue with this headset, battery life. It has a great battery life, I often forget to charge it just due to how long it lasts me. I am a college student who enjoys skateboarding and my quiet studying time, so I am always using these headphones, you'll never find me without them on my college campus. The issue that stems from the battery life is its on-board battery reminder. The headphones will ENSURE you are aware of their current battery life, every few minutes you will be hit with the blaringly loud, annoying, and intrusive reminder that your headset has 6-12 hours of battery life or less than 6 hours. Not the best and most specific way to inform the user of the battery life. This friendly reminder will interrupt anything and everything you are listening too without fail and it will do it fairly consistently over the course of 30 minutes. In fact, prior to this review I had an online meeting and half of my meeting was interrupted by the constant reminder saying, ""6 to 12 hours play time"". This won't shut off your music, video, or call but it will loudly interrupt it. Other than that, I highly recommend this headset for its price range though if you have the money for something better, please get something better.","Reviewed in the United States January 17, 2023",AGNGKZCRCWE4VI5NG7II2HTEKQIQ,True,2,Style: OriginalColor: Black

No significant heat build up noted like other cheaper alternatives.Material is not the ""Sennheiser craftmanship"", but it's okay considering the price and it is not very cheap plastic.Active Noise cancellation is useful to eliminate low end noises to an acceptable extent, but foremost, turning on noise cancellation do not dampen the audio quality like some products out there.

The bass (lows) are actually adjustable slightly in the Smart Control equalizer and iPhone settings, so the bass (lows) are better than expected.BUILD QUALITYThe build quality thus far is good and better than expected.ACTIVE NOISE CANCELLATIONThe ANC (active noise cancellation) is average at best, but does appear to reduce the outside noise by approximately 35%.BLUETOOTH WIRELESS and WIRED CONNECTIVITYThe Bluetooth codecs will be more than enough to please the casual audio listener and on any device. Since these headphones also have wired cable connectivity (better than Bluetooth, playing lossless uncompressed audio), these headphones are all that is needed. The one odd, whether you take it as good or bad, is the audio cable connector is keyed. This provides a locking type of connection so that the cable does not wiggle or loosen easily. Connecting the cable takes getting used to, but works well.SMART CONTROL APPThe Smart Control app has limited functionality. It is too bad you can't control the functions in the app that the physical buttons provide.AMAZON ALEXAThe SE (special edition) version includes Amazon Alexa, if that is important to you, but other than this, both models are identical. I didn't need Alex, but the SE was quite a bit cheaper during one of the Black Friday or Cyber Monday deals for $75.00.CHARGINGI do not believe these are considered fast charging as it took 2 or more hours to fully charge.RECOMMENDATIONI would recommend these headphones at any price range whether at retail or reduced, because of the sound and build quality as well as the other numerous features it offers.","Reviewed in the United States December 13, 2022",AHR5MYSWNWCSTWJ2BPGSBA7KNOFQ,True,12,Style: Special EditionColor: Black

R3TNQBMLUXU1NQ,B083W7V3RG,3.0 out of 5 stars Complete failures,Nobody,3,"I purchased these for my son because of the reviews and the quality of the name.I wish I had done more research. The quality is actually good, but I have multiple issues with these headphones.When my son started using them, he complained that he could only wear them for an hour before they started hurting. Since he is nine, I assumed he was just wearing them a little tight.After about a month he quit using them completely, so I started to use them and gave him a pair of Wyze headphones.After wearing them once, I totally agree with him. First, the padding on the headband is not enough. It would almost be better not to have any since what is there is not enough to matter. In addition to this, the ear cups are so small, they do not actually fit around your ears, but pretty much pin your ears to your head. After a little while of wearing them, the top of your head AND your ears hurt!Moving from the uncomfortable, we go on to the buttons. Whomever thought that it was a good idea to have so many buttons on one ear should be fired. There are five buttons. The power button, volume up/down, a multi-function button that pushes left right and in and another button right next to it. They are also extremely close together. When wearing thin gloves, good luck trying to hit one button. Also, the power button has to be pressed 3 seconds to be turned on, more, it goes into pairing mode, less, no dice. The only indication that they are on is a tiny single click that sounds like static.Next, these headphones do allow you to pair to two different devices, but don't expect multipoint. They are not. Adding to this, if are connected to two devices and walk away from one, a kind voice tells you that they disconnected, and will continue to say it every 20 or 30 seconds and NOT stop. Usually by the 4th or 5th reminder, I turn the headphones ofd and back on. This does fix that. I even emailed support about this and got a generic answer that pretty much said they were working properly.With all of this in mind, these are FAR from worth the price.I have a pair of Sony's and a pair of Wyze. The Sony headphones have better noise cancellation and are far more comfortable for the same price. The Wyze are also far more comfortable, have better noise cancellation, better functionality and only cost $50.","Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2021",AHMWA5IGV2T3NO2NLJL5EA34635Q,True,2,Style: OriginalColor: Black

The controls are reasonably intuitive and I mostly like the multipoint connection - it switched between my computer and phone pretty seamlessly. Stop playing music on one and start it on the other, and the headphones automatically switch sources. I haven't had problems with battery life.The bad:1) Not very comfortable. They squeeze fairly hard which gives me headaches and the ear cups are on the small side which hurt my ears after a bit. I can only wear them for 2-3hrs before I have to take them off.2) Doesn't play nice with MS Teams. When connected via bluetooth they cause MS Teams (for work & school) to crash. Not sure about Teams for personal use. Teams works fine with other bluetooth headsets, with wired headsets, and with the built-in laptop speakers. However, if I try to make a Teams call when these headphones when connected via bluetooth, Teams crashes, my computer thinks it has no audio output devices at all, and I can't listen to music, play videos, make calls, etc using *any* audio output devices until I restart my computer. These headphones *do* work fine with Zoom. I contacted Sennheiser support, and they suggested updating the firmware to the November 2022 version. This didn't fix the problem and they didn't have any other ideas.3) Phone call quality kinda sucks. Tinny, the incoming audio cuts out from time to time, and there's a distracting ambient audio pass-through that is distracting (it amplifies little sounds).Bottom line is that I'm returning them as soon as the other headphones I ordered arrive.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2022",AFO4CUGAPISR5EBB7JO6C2TRIAUQ,True,4,Style: OriginalColor: Black
R2H7L51C3WVD3E,B083W7V3RG,2.0 out of 5 stars Useless for watching TV. AptX LL doesn't seem to work.,MiamiGuitarMan,2,"I'll start with the summary - I am sending these back because they don't work with Bluetooth transmitters using aptx LL for watching TV.What I liked about them - They sound great. I listened to music and watched videos on my laptop both wired and wireless. They really do sound good.The ANC is OK. Nothing great, but it does a half decent job of blocking out consistent droning sounds like leaf blowers, vacuum cleaners, etc... But it doesn't compare to the ANC on headphones like the Bose QC35 II or even the comparably priced Sony H910N. But it's passable.What I didn't like about them and why they are going back -1. I bought these to watch TV without annoying everyone else in the house. My setup is very simple. I have an Avantree Audikast bluetooth transmitter which I've been using with a set of cheap Avantree headphones, but I've been wanting something with better sound.If anyone has every tried watching TV with bluetooth headphones, you may have noticed that the audio and video are usually out of sync. The reason I bought these particular headphones is because they have a codec called AptX LL (low latency) which fixes the problem of the audio and video being out of sync when using bluetooth to watch TV. There are very few headphones currently on the market that support AptX LL so my choices were limited. But I know the Sennheiser name and because these cans use AptX LL, I decided to buy them. The Avantree Audikast also uses AptX LL.Here's the problem - they do connect to the Avantree Audikast but I get no sound. I first used an older Audikast with BT 4 and thought maybe that was the problem so I spent $60 to get an Audikast Plus that uses BT 5.0. It arrived earlier today and I set it up, tried it, same problem. The headphones pair with it but there is no sound. The Audikast Plus even has its own volume control and I thought maybe that would help too but it didn't.I made sure it wasn't a problem with the Audikast and the Audikast Plus by trying two different sets of Avantree headphones, both were different models, that also support AptX LL and both of them worked perfectly.I also tried a set of Bose QC35II, a set of Sonys, and a cheap Jabra. These don't support AptX LL but they did connect and I had no trouble getting sound. But of course, because they don't support AptX LL, I can't really use them for watching TV. But I did use them to make sure that the problem wasn't the Audikast units.I think I've narrowed it down to the Sennheiser's implementation of Aptx LL.So, this is the primary reason they are going back. The AptX LL simply doesn't work.Other things I didn't like - they are very tight and the ear cutouts are too small so they pinned my ears to the side of my head and after a couple of hours they became uncomfortable.The headband has almost no padding and is also uncomfortable after a while.So in addition to them not working at all for watching TV using a BT transmitter that uses Aptx LL, they are also uncomfortable.Overall, sound = 4, ANC = 3, comfort = 2, AptX LL support = 0. Overall, I can't really rate them higher than two stars.","Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2020",AEBR3ASFNWICL7FX6ISOQKYRC5PQ,True,14,Style: OriginalColor: Black

I know people mostly just skim over, so I'll make it short.Pros:-Solid Build, Whole frame is strong, ear cups fit nicely over your ear, honestly just something you get used to that I like, blocks a lot of noise naturally.\-Sound quality is pretty good, I am no audiophile, and to me they sound just as nice as 80$-The battery life is stupidly long, I wear these to bed every night with Bluetooth (noise cancel off) and they easily last 3-5 days, around 45 combined hours.-Usb c means it charges so fast, like in 1 hour it's max charge.-Buttons are a little wierd and gimicy, but they wrk as intended and how you'd expect them too.Cons:-It forces you to use a 1.5mm audio jack, and because they headphones have this dumb locking system I hate, you can't order regular ones or adapters as they won't fit. So if you break them you'd have to order from the company itself.-Whenever your battery is low, every time you have audio and it stops or pauses, it'll tell you the battery is low.-When using Bluetooth there is a buzzing sound when you are not listening to audio (sometimes, it's random).-The part that lays on your head is made from a lower quality material considering the price.-The noise cancelation is worse than some 40$ headphones I've used, which doesn't bother me too much as I never use it, but it's not good for those who care.Conclusion, I wouldn't buy again, purely to try to get butter luck with a different product. I like what I have and the audio when plugged in is amazing, but I can't justify spending this much other than the build quality is stronger than others.

More on that below)+ Great build qualityThe Bad:- These headphones need to be ""broken in"" or ""warmed up"" in order for a very loud crackling to go away. This is apparently a common phenomenon with Sennheisers. I have had mine for about 1.5 months and the crackling still persists when the volume is above half way.- If you have a big head like me, the headphones simply will not fit without top-of-the-head discomfort.- If a device that the headphones are powered to disconnects, your headphones will remind you every 6 seconds (by saying ""LOST CONNECTION"" until the device it was connected to powers back on, OR you turn off the headphones entirely and turn them back on.- The app is terrible and confusing. I love that I can adjust my headphones and update firmware, BUT there needs to be a comprehensive settings menu that is more than two check boxes.The Awful:- When connected to a device, the noise-cancelling lets out a constant static-y ringing noise which is so incredibly annoying. If you want noise cancelling on its own, you either need to be 1) Not connected to a device via Bluetooth, OR 2) have an application or system audio that is playing sound for the sharp ringing to go away.All of the problems that I have listed are apparently sporadically common with others.

If you do an online search for the Sennheiser 450BT, searching for info on it only working in one ear, then you'll be able to find that I'm not alone in having this problem. This is a common problem for these headphones. I have treated them gently. They have only been used indoors at my desk, and they have never been dropped or mishandled in any way. There is no reasonable excuse for their short lifespan at their $100 price point.I highly suggest not only going with a different pair of headphones, but staying away from this brand. My original review is below. I liked them well enough when they worked. However, for $100 I expect more than a little over a year of functionality.ORIGINAL REVIEW:They're comfortable to wear, and music sounds lovely on them. However, they fall short of many of the marketing's claims. As such, I think they're only good for listening to audio, they're awful at the call functions to the point that pairing them with a phone can be a risky move, noise cancellation is poor, and their battery life is poor.I wouldn't use them for calls. The buttons for that are unoptimal, because button 10 is for both music and call functions. I bumped the wrong button function once, and heard them say ""redialing."" That would've been bad if it my headphones been connected to my phone instead of my computer, and the redial worked, because I was listening to music late at night. I disabled their ability to use the call functions on my phone, in my phone's bluetooth device settings, and I recommend doing that if they're purchased.As for noise cancelling, they're pretty poor at it. I hear either slightly muffled noise, or brown noise. I tried comparing outside noises when noise cancellation was both on and off. I noticed no real difference. However, since these headphones cover my ears well, and I don't want to tune everything out, external noise is muffled enough to satisfy me. However, if I traveled often or endured very noisy environments, then I'd be dissatisfied, and so I can't recommend this feature.Their battery life is poor. They're supposed to last 30 hours on a charge. Yet, I find myself needing to charge them daily. I only use them for listening to music and videos, and at a low volume.","Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2023",AEW4ZZK5GGVP6ETGECSKCJLTI3IA,True,24,Style: OriginalColor: Black

They deserve a higher rating but I am also a bit biased because my entire stage is filled with Sennheiser from drums to vocals, sennheiser makes everything simple to dial in. I’ve listened through through these Bluetooth headphones for less than 5 hours and they are scratching the audio itch (if you’re a fellow audiophile like myself, then you know what I’m talking about). I prefer low frequencies and deep bass. These headphones will definitely amplify those frequencies and drown out the surrounding noises with the ANC feature.I am a live audio engineer and I absolutely love when sounds through headphones can put me into a meditative/droning relaxation state. Before this, I’ve owned 2 JBL headphones. The JBL’s sound great but I’ve had a hard time dialing them in because there isn’t an app to help you with frequency dynamics and you’re left with the streaming audio app EQ. Sennheiser has one app to focus on getting the right sound through most of their headphones/earbuds. The combination of the app and headphones definitely scratched an itch I never thought possible in my brain and I am thankful for their technology. I know I sound like a fanboy and I try to aim not to be for any company who develops a product but when the credit is deserved then it is well worth mentioning.

R37LE4OKQ62JI5,B083W7V3RG,5.0 out of 5 stars Rage quit durability and foldable. Soft feel. 2 to 3 days of battery at medium vol lvl.,amber schroeder,5,"Omg I love these. Sleek, well made, rage quit #3 and they are still alive and well😂. They last all day and half the next day for me constantly playing music mid volume lvl. or like 2 to 3 days of and on or keeping on(forgetting to turn off). Call quality/ background noise cancelling is awesome. It matches sound quality you expect from Sennheiser. I wasn't a fan of how heavy they were at first but easy to get used to for sure. In the review photo you can see I have added a small spacer to raise them since my ears are very small and they sat too low. I do not recommend exercising or sweating in them as they slip off but I have tiny head so could very much just be me. They can get warm around the ears but dang do they have excellent noise cancelling and I almost always find myself walking around with them on but no sound on to avoid people talking to me while out and about much more effective than buds but still hear for safety. Easy to get used to buttons. Special note and tip. If they are off, and you get a call, you can turn them on and it will answer the call as soon as you turn them on (if auto connect and Bluetooth is on) Amazing call quality too. All in all its so worth it. Arrived on time for shipping. Be sure you buy authentic!!! Lots of copies being sold now days.

Sennheiser is a pretty prestigious brand, so I expected a good sound quality for the price. Unfortunately, out of the box these headphones are extremely bass heavy and muddy. They lack any high end and the mids feel really buried. There's an app that you can download to EQ the headphones, and that definitely helps, but I feel like having to EQ a set of headphones is a sign that those headphones are not great.Onto comfort:The headphones are KIND OF comfortable, but the ear cups are super narrow. If you're wearing earrings, prepare for them to be pushed against the skin behind your ears - you'll have to readjust. They're a little tight around the head, but I assume that they'll loosen up with time.Overall, I'm disappointed for nearly $100.","Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2023",AF5BIYIQRF7LT5OFHJTAROQRYSNQ,True,1,Style: OriginalColor: Black

I'm almost 80 so my hearing is not as good as it used to be, and I don't like excessively loud music, so my demands are not critical. The phones work fine with my computer when I use the cord. My biggest complaint is comfort. My ears are average size and the SD450SE's do fit over my ears but it's close. They are also tight. They do an adequate job of noise cancellation but since I mostly listen in my home office that's not a particularly important aspect.At the time I bought them they were under the ""return by Jan 31"" time limit and I'm satisfied with them.

R86XG0YNFYVLU,B083W7V3RG,2.0 out of 5 stars Not made for work. Might be poorly made for entertainment,E.L.,2,"I will not recommend this headphone to anyone who plans on using it for work due to the following reasons.First, when working with Microsoft Teams, the head phone would generate a beep every 10s when muted which is really annoying. I googled it online and some articles said that you can turn the “Mute Beeps” off in EPOS Connect. I installed EPOS Connect app both on my cell phone and on my computers, but this app cannot connect to HD 450BT no matter what. I cannot appreciate the fact that the Sennheiser engineer thought adding a mute beep feature by default (especially cannot be easily turned off) is a good idea as it is very distraction, to the extent that you cannot concentrate on what other people is talking about. There is another app called “Smart Connect”, which is offered by Sennheiser, is very limited in functions, at least you cannot change the mute beep in it.Second, HD 450BT has an active noise cancellation feature, but does it only work with listening to music? When working with Microsoft Teams, the headphone would greatly magnify the background noise. Any small sound, even sound you would normally ignore when not using a headphone (like putting a pen on the table) would be heard clearly during meetings. Luckily, only the user hears the magnified sound, not other participants in the phone calls, but is still very annoying. It seems this problem persist when the active noise cancellation feature is either open or closed. I guess the phone want to make you aware of what is going on around you, but too bad you cannot turn the background noise off. Instead, they make it louder for you!I am amused to learn the design philosophy of the Sennheiser engineer of this product. Do they really thing that concentrating on what other people are saying during meetings is not important at all? I will not consider buying any Sennheiser products for a long time, due to their ignorance of the basic requirements of users.For customers buying this product for listening to music only, this might be an acceptable device, even though the sound quality is a little disappointed for a device of its price.","Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2023",AFU2EHQD5OMFX6HSBQB7UUGP72VA,True,0,Style: OriginalColor: Black

Sound quality is exactly what I've come to expect from Sennheiser, which is why I keep buying them. The ear cups are quite comfortable, while the headband is merely OK. It could use some more padding. Bluetooth pairing is easy the first time, and much faster to transfer audio than my last pair of BT headphones.Two downsides: the noise canceling function is on by default, every time you turn the headphones on. I really only want noise canceling for airplanes, not for home use. You can turn it off, but it'll come right back on the next time the headphones do. Second, all the controls are clustered on the right earpiece. Since there are four controls and 2 plugs (USB-C and 3.5mm), it can be a bit annoying to find the one you want, whereas splitting them between the two earpieces would lead to less confusion and fumbling. I want to say these are minor quibbles for an excellent pair of headphones.

R3464MWONOND3Y,B083W7V3RG,5.0 out of 5 stars These headphones seem engineered by designers who truly know sound,MG-ST,5,"I bought these at the same time as the Beats Solo3, and compared to those, the sound quality on these is wonderful. You can hear the separate instruments, which especially matters if one is listening to accoustic music. There is an equalizer app one can download to boost the treble, bass or midrange. It won't give you super booming bass, but perhaps other apps do - I haven't tried any yet. What I mostly like is that the audio is natural and full. The Beats offer more bass, but it's at the expense of compressing the audio. I can't say much about the noise cancelling capabilities, since I use these mainly to listen to music, but if they cared as much about that as they do sound quality, I assume it can't be all that bad. The size of the earpieces seem a bit large, but they are extremely comfortable. I have worn these for hours at a time, whereas with the Beats Solo3, I couldn't stand them for more than 45 minutes because they squeezed my ears and head so hard. The controls are a bit tiny and took some getting used to, but they worked fine. The power button on the Beats cannot be felt by a normal hand unless you can read Braille - it is flat, tiny, and impossible to locate. In short, if sound quality and comfort matter to you - the Sennheiser HD 450 SE wins hands down.","Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2023",AHWTGXHBKVA3TQEH7KTKI3VHZHUQ,True,3,Style: Special EditionColor: Black

I am going to address most of the complaints in others reviews.The Active noise cancellation is great for a $150 headphones, but high price headphones from microsoft, or sony, or bose that's probably 200-400 dollars will blow these out of the water. But it does work, and it does block out noises. Most effectively: repeating noise like that of a car or a train or an airplane or air conditioners, etc. It blocks out voices, but not that much. You can definitely hear others when your not listening to anything.The sound quality can also be thrown out when considering other headphones. Sennheiser creates headphones with the best sound quality, but this pair of headphones wasn't really created for that. It has every quality a good $150 dollar wireless headphones has, that a lot of other headphones don't have. So you can't really say it sucks, because it has a different purpose. However, the sound still rocks. It's so clear and precise. The best bang for your buck if you're a casual listener that doesn't want to spend too much.Battery life is one of the best so nuff said really.I have not experienced hissing sounds and the music quality is very very great. I have experienced bad sounds/ hiss when the audio jack is not properly attached though. The audio cable needs to be inserted in a specific way. If it isn't you will experience what a $1 headphones sounds like.Latency is definitely there even if the product claims low latency. It's manageable, but it still is very noticeable.It has a light build and is smaller than expected. As some claim its ear cups and headband are too small, it fits nicely with me, and it isn't even fully adjusted yet. I think most people would like it. If you have a big head/ears though, don't waste your money and time ordering these. I can wear this for hours though.The free case is small, if you travel a lot and have some extra cash to burn, I'd suggest ordering something to go with these.The worst problem for me is the comfort-ability while wearing glasses.

I was in need of a pair of headphones for my work laptop, and I trusted the Sennheiser brand based upon their stellar reputation for quality audio devices. I wish I hadn't.The headphones were entirely unable to maintain a connection to any device, furthermore the reset procedure for the 450bt's, as explicitly directed by the manufacturer, did nothing at all. Upon further investigation, I discovered that this is a known issue with this specific model, that Sennheiser is aware of the issue, and that they either can't or won't offer a solution outside of return despite continuing to sell the product. This has changed my perception of the company, and I don't think I can take their reputation as a quality manufacturer seriously going forward. The quality assurance for their products doesn't seem to be worth much. I have returned my headphones, and my next purchase will likely be a Bose or Sony product.To be perfectly frank, these headphones are one of the worst appliances I've ever purchased.

They are a little large where they fit on the headphone and will stay on. My ears fit inside unlike the original pads.I wanted a good sounding wireless headphone. These did the job for me. If the music has deep bass then you will hear it. I like headphones that have a flat frequency response. I want to hear the music as it is, not how some headphones makes extra bass. I like the fit and I do not agree these are not over the ear. To get a good fit I move them side to side over my ears to get the best fit/sound for me. I can listen for many hours and no pain on the ears. The battery does have a long life before needing a recharge. I tried with and without ANC and it sounds good on both. When it is off the sound had a wider frequency response. I like how it folds and I know it comes with a soft case and I bought the LTGEM hard case. I did not buy or use these to use on phone calls so no info how good that works. As far as the ANC it works for the little testing I did. Just around the house.

Great battery life!In terms of functionality is a shame the don’t either power off nor stop playing when folded. Kudos on the mic.Finally, noise canceling does a decent job however while phone calling it automatically sets off which is not ideal, thanks to the good noise isolation from the padding is easy to hear clearly.

R38RYCTZP444HB,B083W7V3RG,2.0 out of 5 stars Decent sounding headphones with a handful of issues that some might find deal breaking.,Dave P.,2,"I bought these thinking they were over ear headphones, but they're actually on ear, and my ears get painful to the touch after half an hour of wearing on ear headphones, so I generally avoid them like the plague. Thinking these were over ear, I bought them because they are a well know name brand I've used before and trust, and because they are also AptX-LL, which I needed.I only use then with my TV watching videos (Netflix, Prime, Disney+, etc.) or playing console games, and for that they sound great and have zero perceptible delay. They are plastic, and feel plastic, so they're not as premium feeling as my Microsoft Surface headphones, but they are still well worth the sale price of $100USD I paid for them, though I don't believe they'd be worth the regular asking price of $150USD, especially factoring in the firmware issue discussed further on.The noise cancellation does appear to work, but I didn't buy them for that as they are only ever going to be used at home, so the quality of the NC isn't a big deal to me.Another small annoyance I noticed was that it has a 2.5mm jack on it for using in wired mode. Now it does include a cord that is 2.5mm on one end and 3.5mm on the other end for attaching it to your phone or tablet or whatever you want to, but that requires that you always have the specific cord that came with it as opposed to using regular audio cables that are 3.5mm on both ends. Once again, I'm able to look past this due to my use case being for at home TV viewing only.I tried to update the firmware using the companion app, and it took five hours, no joke. Notice I said try, because after that five f***ing hours updating, it failed and said to try again. I decided to forego trying to update the firmware again as it's not that big a deal, again because they are for at home TV viewing only.Aside from the pain of wearing them and the horrendous firmware updating issue, I'm still happy with my purchase. My issues might be deal breakers for others, at the same time though, my use case is limited, so I can look past those issues. Others looking to use these as everyday use might want to look elsewhere if they have sensitive ears and don't want to wait five hours for a firmware update to ultimately fail.Once I have created some kind of adapter that will allow me to convert the ear cups to aftermarket over ear foam pads instead the included on ear pads, they'll be perfect for me and my limited use case.","Reviewed in the United States December 12, 2020",AHZZCKWWWKOAWONQQV5CZL7JGJVQ,True,4,Style: OriginalColor: Black

Product support was slow, through email, and took well over a week, after multiple emails, for them to finally send me an RMA to a service center. They DO NOT PAY shipping. So, their product failed but I have to pay to get it to them, go figure. Now I'm looking at several weeks for the repair and return. The headphones are good but not so good that I'd go through this again - not worth the hassle.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AH7XTXOYNZ67GQ4JKG5YSVNG7A5A,True,1,Style: Special EditionColor: Black
R2BHPXT27TFFAK,B083W7V3RG,4.0 out of 5 stars Tight on my head,Siobhan Umsu,4,"They have great sound. I needed the wire connectivity for remote proceedings as a court reporter. I will use them for that and for transcribing jobs, most likely for a few hours at a time. I wasn’t worried about the bass, highs, and lows per say like an audiophile would, but these have great sound for what I use them for for work. I just got them and have enjoyed them for home, so far watching Netflix. The sound and battery is great for that, but they are a bit tight on my head. I’m not a small human, but I am a female with a pretty regular-sized head and I definitely know they’re there and find myself repositioning them frequently because they squeeze my head just a bit too tight. Im hoping they loosen up with use and will update my review either way.","Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2023",AGBWXAPDQF23EACK4ZWLIKUWVIJQ,True,0,Style: OriginalColor: Black
R2UIWCLMU010S8,B083W7V3RG,2.0 out of 5 stars Malfunctioned after 6 months,Henley Zeng,2,"I had no problem with these for the first 5 months of use. The sound is a little quiet, but it is decent and they're comfortable.One day while connected by Bluetooth, the right side just stops outputting sound.While looking for a fix, I discover this turns out to be a VERY common problem with no resolution. Sennheiser has no official fix for it.For $100 I wasn't expecting it to be the best thing ever, but Sennheiser had historically been a brand I trusted for quality. Unfortunately, after this experience I would not recommend anyone buy these and will probably be avoiding Sennheiser in the future.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2024",AEAG7DN6GZC2ONRDUSR4JFTYSKKA,True,0,Style: OriginalColor: Black

The ANC is good given the cost of the headphones, but the sound leaves much to be desired. I have tried fiddling with the app to adjust the quality to no avail.

R25YKWB31LLCHC,B083W7V3RG,1.0 out of 5 stars Such a disappointment!,Uriah Findley,1,"Holy god these are surprisingly bad. Where do I even start?- The volume level is pretty low. This, combined with...- The enclosures are not isolated at all, sonically. Which means that it can't be heard over the train I ride where I live, which is not hard for most headphones with good volume and isolation. That can be also compensated for by good noise cancellation. But unfortunately...- The noise cancellation blows. And of course, it's pretty useless if all the noise is just leaking in and drowning out the sound of the headphones anyways.- If you pair these with two devices, like your phone and laptop, and then walk out of the house....the headphones will warn you via voice that you have lost connection. Over, and over, and over, and over....perpetually, until you actually turn them off and turn them back on, re-pair with the device near you only. To confirm this I once let it warn me I had been disconnected from my laptop for a solid 15 minutes.- If you're paired with two devices, the headphones will often simple refuse to play sound from one of the devices, despite showing as still paired. This also requires a shutdown/re-pair with ONLY your desired device.- Also, sometimes on my Macbook Pro M1, they just don't make any sound. Paired alone, selected as the OS audio output...and it clicks once when sound is supposed to play and then does nothing. I still haven't found a good fix for this other than rebooting, shutting of and re-pairing the headphones. And that doesn't work a lot of the time either.Overall, just a horrible experience from an otherwise great manufacturer. I can't recommend enough NOT buying these.","Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2024",AFN3N7ALINAFZEA43OOT7GY2QEAQ,True,0,Style: OriginalColor: Black

It's to the point that I can't even get it to play more than 3 seconds of something on my laptop before it turns off on its own! I have been trying to get help from the manufacturer to see what the problem is for months now and have not heard anything. When I look on Reddit, similar problems are happening for others, and no one has been able to find a way to solve it, aside from removing the device and reinstalling it again and again... Like I said, it sounds amazing when it works.... but it generally doesn't work.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AGKYHK5NOKDBDAXVPEVJKAXNTKIA,True,0,Style: OriginalColor: Black

We both agree that the sound quality is amazing, just a little neutral out of the box. It comes with a great app for adjusting the EQ to your personal preference. The headphones are comfortable and I can wear them for hours on end without fatiguing my neck. I love being able to quickly adjust the EQ in the app based on the music I feel like listening to, and the ANC is great. It's not the strongest ANC I've experienced, but it definitely helps drown out the background noise around you, and you can turn it on and off with a simple single press on the power button.
